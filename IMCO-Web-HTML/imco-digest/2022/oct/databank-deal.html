			<p><strong>Behind the deal: IMCO invests up to US$450 million in DataBank</strong></p>
		   <p>In October, IMCO <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/imco-announces-IMCO-signs-agreement-to-acquire-equity-interest-in-databank/index.html" target="_blank">announced</a> a US$450 million investment in DataBank, the largest edge infrastructure
operator in the U.S.</p>

			<p>IMCO's Senior Principal in Infrastructure <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/member/fred-robert/index.html" target="_blank">Fred Robert</a> led the transaction process and takes us behind the
deal:</p>
		  
		  <p><em>What makes this an attractive investment for clients?</em></p>

			<p>We've acquired a stake in DataBank for US$450 million. DataBank's datacenters are mission-critical for
its customers and underpin the operations of thousands of organizations in the U.S., including blue-chip
enterprises, financial institutions, hyperscalers, network carriers, and government organizations.
DataBank represents an investment in a mission-critical business; offers inflation protection through
contractual and structural mechanisms; delivers strong risk-adjusted return with downside protection;
and exhibits favourable ESG attributes as the company plans to transition to Net Zero by 2030.
This investment allows IMCO and its clients to capitalize on the secular tailwinds of continued
digitization and the trend of data generation and consumption becoming increasingly decentralized. This
trend requires data storage, processing and hosting to be on a more distributed basis, closer to
consumption. DataBank is the largest "distributed" datacenter operator in the US with a portfolio of 65+
datacenters serving 27+ markets, and a growth pipeline that will take the company's portfolio from
360MW to 500MW+.</p>
		  
			<p><em>What sets DataBank apart from other operators in the digital infrastructure space?</em></p>

			<p>In addition to being the third largest datacenter operator in the US, DataBank's portfolio of datacenters
is uniquely and strategically positioned to take advantage of increasingly decentralized data generation
and consumption. It has presence in key growth markets in the US, with a portfolio of 65+ operational
datacenters across 27+ markets. DataBank also has a highly experienced management team supported
by DigitalBridge, a leading digital infrastructure investor and asset manager.</p>

		  <p><em>Why is IMCO proud of this transaction?</em></p>
		  <p>This opportunity has been secured on a fee-free basis and represents the Infrastructure Team's first
direct investment in the datacenter space, complementing our existing fiber investment in euNetworks.
IMCO will hold one board seat and will be investing alongside other institutional investors including
Swiss Life Asset Management, CBRE Caledon, and Northleaf Capital. IMCO will work with the DataBank
management team and other shareholders to drive the ESG agenda, with near-term focus on increasing
		  diversity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
		  <p><em>If there's one thing clients should know about this transaction, what should that be?</em></p>
		  <p>Our stake in DataBank is an investment that will deliver strong risk-adjusted return with downside
			  protection while also being a responsible investment as it is in a low emissions sector.</p>
