			<p><strong>Behind the deal: IMCO's US$1.0 billion global credit investment</strong></p>
		   <p>IMCO <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/imco-announces-a-us1-0-billion-global-credit-investment-with-loomis-sayles-and-beach-point/" target="_blank">announced</a> a US$1 billion allocation to two of the world's leading global credit managers, Loomis,
Sayles &amp; Co. ("Loomis"); and Beach Point Capital Management ("Beach Point"). Our clients now have
enhanced access to investment grade debt, high-yield bonds, structured credit, and leveraged loans &#8211; further diversifying their assets and exposure to attractive, risk-adjusted return potential.</p>

			<p>IMCO's Global Credit Portfolio Manager Fernando Martinez led the transaction process and takes us behind the deal:</p>

			<p><em>Why does IMCO think that it is important for clients to have exposure to actively managed public credit?</em></p>

			<p>Actively managed credit offers the potential to generate superior returns for our clients without having
to dramatically increase the risk budget. The multi-sector nature of the mandate allows the selected
managers to be nimble across different sub-asset classes within the public credit market. As an example,
our mandate gave both Loomis and Beach Point the flexibility to tap into the leveraged loans market at
the beginning of the year to capture raising rising rates, and then rotate the positions into the high yield
space in the late second quarter to capitalize on the price dislocation and volatility, without compromising
on credit quality.</p>

		  <p><em>How did IMCO select these two managers?</em></p>

		<p>Our selection process was exhaustive, including three phases of due diligence and multiple virtual
meetings with prospects, finalists, and the selected managers. We followed a rigorous and comprehensive
process, canvassing the market for managers with:</p> 
		  
	      <ul>
		      <li>The full set of capabilities to manage a multi-asset active credit mandate</li>
		      <li>A strong track record across multiple credit cycles; and</li>
		      <li>A proven, yet distinctive, competitive edge that aligned with IMCO's strategic goals and targets identified for the mandate</li>
        </ul>

<p>We designed the mandate to be complementary in nature by combining two managers investing in the
same space but with uncorrelated strategies. We chose Loomis as our Top-Down, "core", manager. They
will generate alpha (superior market results) primarily via sector selection. Beach Point will serve as our
"high-conviction", Bottom-Up manager. From them, alpha is expected to be generated from individual
security selection.</p>
<p><em>Why is IMCO proud of this transaction?</em></p>

<p>It is rewarding to execute a strategy that will give our clients investment solutions that provide a superior
level of diversification in moments of market stress and volatility.</p>

<p>I'm personally proud of the teamwork and collaboration across IMCO. Every team involved recognized
the strategic value of this transaction for our clients and went above and beyond to execute the
mandate.</p>
