			<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Behind the deal: IMCO invests $400 million in Northvolt AB</span></strong><br>
			  
	    <p>In June, IMCO announced a US $400 million <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/news/2023-06-20.html" target="_blank">investment in Northvolt AB</a>, to support its mission to produce the world's greenest lithium-ion battery with the lowest carbon footprint. </p>
		  
		  <p>This investment was a strategic collaboration between IMCO's Fundamental Equities and Global Infrastructure groups. Senior Portfolio Manager in Fundamental Equities <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/investment-team/michael-tsada.html" target="_blank">Michael Tsada</a> led the transaction process and takes us behind the deal:</p>

		  <p><strong>What opportunity does this transaction present to our clients?</strong></p>
	    <p>The Northvolt investment enables our clients to capitalize on the massive growth of the global automotive fleet electrification market. The shift to a low-carbon economy presents significant opportunities and this transaction is a great example of a future-proof asset that will benefit clients over the long term. Our investment in Northvolt also demonstrates our unwavering commitment to driving a sustainable future while delivering strong risk-adjusted returns. Investing in Northvolt offers a unique mix of upside participation and downside protection over a multi-year period.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>What attracted IMCO to Northvolt?</strong></p>
	    <p>We were attracted to Northvolt's vision to build a fully integrated electric vehicle ("EV") battery platform for Europe in a sustainable and ethical way. Northvolt's platform spans R&amp;D, raw materials processing, battery production, and battery recycling, which allows it to truly close the loop with old batteries, eventually turning them into new ones. Northvolt's integrated approach allows it to fully capitalize on the large tailwind of electrification of the global automotive fleet. By utilizing fossil-free energy in its operations and incorporating recycled battery materials into its production, Northvolt has materially reduced the carbon intensity of its battery production and is on track to deliver the world's greenest battery. Northvolt's significant commercial progress, as evidenced by more than $55 billion dollars in secured contracts with leading global automakers, also made this a particularly attractive opportunity. </p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Tell us how this deal came about? </strong></p>
		  
		  <p>We have been researching the EV transition for a few years now and have met with numerous companies in the EV ecosystem. IMCO's Infrastructure group, through our acquisition of Pulse Clean Energy, was also able to provide unique insights into the battery industry. When we heard about Northvolt's plans to raise capital, we were ready to capitalize on the opportunity. With IMCO's <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/climate-action.html" target="_blank">Climate Action Plan</a> in place, the investment team was able to quickly recognize how an investment in Northvolt could support our climate objectives.</p>
