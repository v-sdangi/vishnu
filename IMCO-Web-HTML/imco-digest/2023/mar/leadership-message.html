		<p><strong>Raneet Aggarwal, CFO, shares insights on IMCO's cost competitiveness that helps deliver on our public purpose </strong><br>
		<p>Raneet Aggarwal took on the role of Chief Financial Officer in 2022, after serving as IMCO's Vice President, Corporate Finance for five years. Under Raneet's leadership, IMCO's Finance team remains committed to our public purpose mandate, fostering a cost-conscious culture and promoting cost management discipline throughout the organization. </p>
		  <p>This month Raneet shares insights into the factors that influence costs and how IMCO's Finance team goes beyond analyzing numbers to provide greater value for clients. </p>
		  
		  <p><strong>How does IMCO manage costs to ensure clients receive value?</strong></p>
	    <p>One of IMCO's fundamental investment beliefs is that costs matter, and it is one of the things an investor can control. IMCO's mandate is to provide cost-competitive leading investment advisory and management solutions. Cost consciousness has been embedded in our culture since day one and is a cornerstone in our <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/five-year-strategic-plan.html" target="_blank">Five-Year Strategic Plan</a>.</p>
		  <p>We use internal and peer metrics, as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate our cost efficiency, and our budgets are developed with our clients' interests in mind. We believe that steady enhancements to our investment management and operational capabilities are necessary to drive value for our clients, ensuring that costs incurred are aligned with our objectives and strategy.</p>
		  
	    <p><strong>IMCO has experienced rapid grown since its inception five years ago, and with growth comes increased costs. Can you provide insight into IMCO's costs and the future trend in costs?</strong></p>  
	    <p>Over the last five years we have built IMCO from the ground up - both in scale and complexity - we have managed investment costs at a relatively competitive rate of 70.4 bps. This was achieved by capturing savings from a variety of sources such as rationalizing investment managers, leveraging our scale and relationships to negotiate lower fees, internalization of investment capabilities and other operational initiatives. </p>
		<p>Our costs are directly driven by our clients' strategic asset allocation decisions. As clients continue to evolve asset allocation toward private markets, these decisions are inherently higher cost (and higher expected return) strategies. In addition, while our development of investment operational functions and capabilities have outlay costs, the long-term benefits of these initial investments drive practical value and efficiencies for our clients. </p>
		  
	    <p><strong>What about continued growth? How will costs change as the fund increases in size? </strong></p>
	    <p>We are pleased to have generated savings in recent years, while offering our clients many additional value-added services. Looking ahead, IMCO will incur additional costs as we further develop our internal investment management capabilities and support model, while remaining focused on delivering strong returns. These increased IMCO costs will be offset by the reduction of external management fees. </p>
		  <p>By 2027, total costs are projected to be approximately 77 bps, delivering an estimated additional $180 million in net savings.</p>
		  <p>As we grow our AUM through asset returns and/or acquisition of new clients, greater economies of scale will allow us to achieve better cost-efficiencies.</p>
		  
		<p><strong>What plans are in place that will enable IMCO to operate more efficiently, while achieving investment excellence? </strong></p>
	    <p>Our strategic plans include investing in our infrastructure to improve operational efficiency and further enhancing our investment capabilities.</p>
<p>Pooling of our private market asset classes is a continued focus in 2023-2024, which will allow us to streamline and standardize investment operations and client reporting, while greatly reducing the administrative work required to manage segregated assets. Establishing a middle office will allow investment teams to focus more time and effort on core investing activities. As well, to support greater internalization and the full front-to-back investment lifecycle for all private asset classes, IMCO will cost-effectively implement a private markets portfolio management system over the next 2-3 years.</p>

		<p><strong>What role does Finance play in delivering client success?</strong></p>
	    <p>In addition to being the trusted advisor to our clients, our clients also rely on IMCO to both deliver strong investment returns and provide timely, accurate and relevant investment information. This information comes from various teams like Corporate Finance, Valuation, Tax and Performance who all work together in collaboration with Investment Operations to provide valuable financial insights to our clients.</p> 
		  <p>In 2022, the Finance team partnered closely with the Investment Operations and Client Relationship Management teams to design a Client Financial Reporting and Services (FRS) mode. Furthermore, a key focus in 2023 will be implementing the framework, including process and related reporting enhancements. We also successfully completed a major milestone, our first SOC 1 Type II Report, which provides clients with independent assurance that the investment financial information that we provide is reliable, high quality and accurate.</p>
<p>I am excited for what is in store in the year ahead and look forward to continuing to lead our focus on cost competitiveness to ensure we deliver value and success to our clients.</p>
