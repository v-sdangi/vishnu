			<p><strong>Craig Ferguson speaks about main drivers of inflation on Spotlight podcast</strong></p>
			  
	    <p>Craig Ferguson, Managing Director, Private Equity, was featured again in Spotlight's miniseries "Private Markets and the End of Cheap Money. The series examines how private equity firms are adapting to an environment of higher interest rates and more expensive borrowing costs. </p>
		
	    <p>Craig shares his view on inflation, in particular, watching rising labour costs and the impact of rising energy prices on Europe:</p>
	    <p>"I think labour has been a main driver of inflation, in many of the situations we have seen. Fortunately, we are seeing companies in our portfolio that are able to pass that through. We are very focused on what the labour markets look like. I think when you look at the U.S. Fed that's what they are focused on as a key barometer. Labour costs, labour force participation is key."</p>
		  <p>IMCO is focused on making investments that can help strengthen the resiliency of the portfolio in any environment. In an inflationary environment, investing in companies with pricing control and secular demand is especially attractive, and this approach is reflected in the direct and co-investment transactions IMCO closed last year, which included:</p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Trinity Life Sciences - a provider of commercialization solutions to the North American bio pharma industry</li>
			  <li>Barracuda Networks - a cloud-first cybersecurity solutions provider for small and medium-sized enterprises</li>
			  <li>Emler Swim School - an owner-operator of private swim schools and the fifth largest private swim school in the U.S.</li>
			  <li>123Dentist - a network of dental practices. IMCO invested to support the merger with Altima Dental to create one of the largest dental support organizations in Canada </li>
			  <li>CDK Global Inc. - a software provider to North American auto and non-auto dealerships</li>
			  <li>Beeline - the largest independent extended workforce management software platform that supports large enterprises</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p>The other panelists describe how general economic performance and geopolitics also impact rates, as does energy prices. Craig points out that IMCO is taking a cautious approach in Europe due to rising energy prices there. </p>
		  <p>"Consumers' disposable income is definitely getting squeezed across Europe in a very meaningful way... We have dry powder and we are optimistic about the future. But in terms of doubling down or applying more capital at this stage, I think we are in a bit of a wait and see... as we watch those countries kind of deal with the energy price situation."</p>
		  <p>Craig went into more detail about IMCO's approach to private equity investing in a previous <a href="https://pei.podbean.com/e/how-lps-are-approaching-private-equity-in-the-era-of-higher-rates/" target="_blank">episode.</a></p>
