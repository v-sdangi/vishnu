			<p><strong>Remaining focused on enhancing the client experience</strong><br>
			  
	    <p>Client success is a key pillar to IMCO's new five-year strategic plan. To help us reach this pillar, we will employ a client-focused mindset across the organization. This means placing clients at the core of decisions and processes to continuously enhance the client experience in order to build sustainable and mutually beneficial long-term relationships.</p>
	    <p>IMCO launched a learning initiative for all staff last quarter focused on the foundational concepts of client success and relationship management. It was important that all staff complete the training because building an organization that is focused on delivering a consistent, positive client experience is a team effort - meaning that it requires every individual at IMCO to consider how they contribute to our overall public purpose. IMCO employees embraced the program and were highly engaged throughout the activities, events and learning sessions linked to this initiative. </p>
	  <em> <p>"It was both impressive and inspiring to see how committed everyone at IMCO was to the Client Success learning initiative. Building awareness of client success concepts and how to support IMCO's public purpose is an essential part of our mandate." - Sofia Assaf, Senior Vice President, Client Relationship Management </p></em>
	  <p>While we are proud of the success of this initiative, we are well aware that enhancing the client experience does not end with one course. Throughout 2023, IMCO will continue to build our client engagement program by taking a more proactive approach to client communications, connecting with clients on topics of interest and providing ongoing training to foster a client-focused mindset. </p>
	    <p>We are committed to client success because we recognize that in addition to a strong investment performance track record, client experience is an important consideration. Through quality enhancements and continuous learning, we remain steadfast on providing a positive client experience. <br>
