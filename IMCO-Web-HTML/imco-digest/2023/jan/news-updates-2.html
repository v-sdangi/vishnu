			<p><strong>Remaining focused on enhancing the client experience</strong><br>
			  
	    <p>Client success is a key pillar to IMCO's new 5-year strategic plan. To help us reach this pillar, we will foster a client-focused mind-across the organization. This means we keep our clients' best interests front of mind when making decisions that impact them.  </p>
	    <p>IMCO launched learning initiative for staff to illustrate how everyone at IMCO directly or indirectly impacts, and influences the client experience. It was important that all staff complete the training because building an organization that is focused on delivering a consistent positive client experience, requires every individual at IMCO to consider how they contribute to our overall public purpose. IMCO employees embraced the program with high levels of engagement across the activities, events, and learning sessions that were linked to this initiative. </p>
	  <em>  <p>It is both impressive and inspiring to see how committed everyone at IMCO is to the Client Success learning initiative. Building awareness of client success concepts and how to support IMCO on this essential part of our mandate. - Sofia Assaf, SVP, CRM</p></em>
	  <p>Enhancing the client experience does not end with one course. Throughout 2023 IMCO will implement several quality client engagement enhancements such as taking a more proactive approach to client communications, hosting meets with leaner agendas and promptly executing on action items, and continued training to continually foster a client-focused mindset.  </p>
	    <p>We are committed to client success because we realize that in addition to a strong investment performance track record, a positive client experience is an important consideration for you. Through quality enhancements and continuous learning, we remain steadfast on providing you with a positive client experience.<br>
