			<p><strong>Craig Ferguson joins Private Equity International's podcast</strong></p>
			  
	    <p>In December, Craig Ferguson, Managing Director, Private Equity, was featured on Private Equity International's podcast, Spotlight. Craig shared IMCO's approach to private equity investing, how we're improving the resiliency of the portfolio and where we see investing opportunities in an uncertain environment. </p>
		
	    <p>Despite a soft market that has many external managers stretching their fundraising dates into 2023, in an attempt to secure additional capital from institutional investors, IMCO was able to commit approximately $2-billion in 2022. Craig credits IMCO's differentiated approach to investing for its ability to deploy capital in this environment, along with relationships with external managers: </p>
	    <p><em>&quot;We are bringing a two-pronged approach to the market: investing in funds in leading managers primarily in North America and also in Europe. We're also building a large direct investing capability that focuses on partnering with those managers: being a large investor in their funds, being a large co-investor, a large co-underwriter in their transactions. We are looking for differentiated relationships. The market is feeling a little bit soft, and a lot of [external] managers are stretching their dates into 2023 to get additional allocations from institutions. We will probably commit approximately $2 billion this year to managers, a lot of that is re-up capital, although we are selectively adding managers. We will continue next year adding significant amounts. And I think that differentiates us in the market: we build relationships with these general partners (GPs) before they're in market and in transactional mode [so we're already top of mind for them.]"</em></p>
	    <p>Craig also described how his team is improving the resiliency of IMCO's Private Equity portfolio: </p>
<p><em>"We have been focused on adding managers and investing directly in transactions where we feel there's resiliency over a cycle. That's part of our underwriting from the get-go. The businesses and managers we're focused on are those who can create value in an up and down market by executing their value creation plans." </em></p>
<p>Attractive opportunities also exist in infrastructure, real assets and private credit, according to Craig. Thanks to IMCO's diverse portfolio, we are well-positioned to use our toolkit across asset classes to take advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p>Lastly, Craig details how we are starting to see more and more attractive opportunities on the credit and infrastructure side, and we have capital to invest in growing programs in these verticals. <em>&quot;When you look at the opportunistic investing, we can be a little more pointed in those areas.&quot;</em></p>
