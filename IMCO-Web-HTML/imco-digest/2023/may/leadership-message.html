		  <p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Supporting IMCO's future growth by building our foundational systems and processes</span></strong></p>
		  
		<p>As Chief Operating Officer, <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/executive-team/tony-algar.html" target="_blank">Tony Algar</a> oversees the effective integration and deployment of key functions across IMCO, including IT, Investment Operations, and Strategic Development and Project Management. </p>
		  
		  <p>Investing in our internal infrastructure is a critical component of IMCO's <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/five-year-strategic-plan.html" target="_blank">Five-Year Strategic Plan</a> to improve operational efficiency. This month, Tony provides an update on some priority projects that will evolve our operational capabilities and help deliver client success.</p>
		 
		  <p><strong>Developing a portfolio management solution for private assets</strong></p>
	    <p>A key objective in IMCO's Strategic Plan is to increase the amount of private assets we manage internally, driven by our clients' focus on evolving their strategic asset allocation (SAA) toward private markets. </p>
		  <p>To support this internalization of private assets, we are implementing a portfolio management solution tailored to the management and administration of all private asset classes. The design and planning of the solution has begun, with implementation and deployment of the full solution expected to take 18-24 months to complete.</p>
		  <p>In the meantime, we have an interim solution into place that provides our investment teams with more timely and insightful reporting, enhances our private asset data collection and lowers IMCO's operating costs by reducing our need for support from external providers.
		  </p>	  
		<p><strong>Building a private markets middle office to strengthen our focus on investing activities</strong></p>
		<p>IMCO has launched an initiative to build a middle office for our private markets teams, creating a single touchpoint between the investment teams and support functions across the organization. This structure would remove administrative tasks from the investment teams and provide them with timely access to data, allowing them to focus their time and effort on sourcing investment opportunities for our clients.
		</p>
		  <p>The initiative was piloted with the Infrastructure team and we expect to extend the capability to the Global Credit and Private Equity teams over the remainder of 2023.</p>
		  <p><strong>Integrating our Technology and Data teams</strong></p>
		  <p>Last month, we made the strategic decision to combine our Technology and Data groups into one team, given the combined role of technology and data as business enablers and their role in supporting the delivery of IMCO's <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/five-year-strategic-plan.html" target="_blank">Five-Year Strategic Plan</a>.</p>
		  <p>This change will allow IMCO to achieve scalability of a common architecture, integrated planning and an enhanced focus on business outcomes. It will also streamline points of contact and decision making, while leveraging a deeper pool of expertise for providing holistic solutions.</p>
		  <p>By enriching our portfolio management operations, enhancing our administrative efficiency and evolving our technology infrastructure, I am confident that we are advancing our foundational system and processes, and allowing us to focus on IMCO's next chapter.</p>
		  <p>I look forward to bringing this plan to fruition, as we develop the systems, data, and processes to support our clients in achieving their investment objectives.</p>		  
		  
		<p>Tony Algar<br>Chief Operating Officer</p>
