			<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Behind the deal: IMCO acquires German renewable energy company, NeXtWind Capital Ltd.</span></strong><br>
			  
	    <p>On August 9, IMCO, together with our fund partner Sandbrook Capital ("Sandbrook"), and PSP Investments ("PSP"), <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/news/2023-08-08.html" target="_blank">announced</a>
			an equity commitment of up to US $750 million to acquire NeXtWind and its existing portfolio of operating onshore wind assets and to fund future growth. <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/investment-team/alex-side.html" target="_blank">Alex Side</a>, a Senior Principal on the IMCO Infrastructure investment team, led the transaction and takes us behind the deal:</p>
		  
		  <ol>
			  <li><strong>What does this deal mean for our clients?</strong><br>
			  <p>This deal increases our clients' exposure to the renewable energy sector with significant tailwinds expected to provide strong risk-adjusted returns. This direct investment will also deepen IMCO's industry expertise in clean energy that will be levered to secure additional investments and improve asset management practices across IMCO's investment portfolio.</p>
			  </li>
			  <li><strong>What attracted IMCO to NeXtWind?</strong><br>
			  <p>NeXtWind stood out to us as a leader in the German renewable energy sector and we were drawn to the opportunity to support the growth of an established renewable energy platform. With their deep network of relationships among onshore wind project owners, a proactive stance in securing land and planning/zoning approvals, comprehensive development capabilities, and a leading management team renowned for renewable energy investments in Germany, we knew they were well positioned to succeed. </p>
				  <p>Germany is the largest power market and leading greenhouse gas ("GHG") emitter in the European Union ("EU"). Germany has committed to more ambitious GHG reduction targets for 2030 than the EU, underscoring the importance of renewable energy in meeting those goals. Historically, Germany has pioneered onshore wind energy, boasting Europe's oldest fleet of projects. Repowering these projects is vital to the country's climate objectives. </p>
		  		  <p>While NeXtWind is currently focused on onshore wind repowering in the German market, we are excited to explore opportunities to invest in complementary renewable sectors (including greenfield onshore wind and co-located solar and energy storage) and expand into new markets in the coming years given repowering will play an important role in the energy transition across Europe. </p>				  
			  </li>		
			  <li><strong>Tell us how the deal came about?</strong><br>
			  <p>We've been assessing renewable energy opportunities for a few years now. The Infrastructure team identified repowering onshore wind as a potentially attractive investment theme, noting lower development risks and quicker development timelines compared to greenfield developments. The German market, with its strong regulatory and political support for renewables and repowering, emerged as an attractive choice. The challenge was identifying a management team that could execute our strategy.</p>
				  <p>The deal formed when Sandbrook approached IMCO to invest in its inaugural clean energy transition focused fund, the Climate Infrastructure Fund I. Through those discussions, it became evident that we both recognized opportunity in Germany's repowering sector and Sandbrook had already connected with the best-in-class management team at NeXtWind. As our dialogue continued with Sandbrook, we met the NeXtWind team and viewed them as a great fit in our direct portfolio. This process strengthened our relationship with Sandbrook and, along with our investment in NeXtWind, we also made an investment in their fund.</p>
		  		  <p>The NeXtWind deal offered us the ability to close a large direct investment alongside a fund commitment and opportunities to directly invest in Sandbrook's energy transition investments in the future.</p>				  
			  </li>		
			  <li><strong>How does this transaction fit in with the Infrastructure team's strategy?</strong><br>
			  <p>This transaction fits with Infrastructure's objective to invest C$4.0 to 5.0 billion in clean energy transition investments by 2027 and increase the program's exposure to direct investments. The NeXtWind transaction is aligned with Infrastructure's strategy of investing in core jurisdictions that support renewables.</p>
				  <p>One of the key elements of our business strategy is to help found and grow businesses. We believe that investing early in a company's life cycle allows us to manage risk and participate in upside as they grow. This is a great example of investing in a company with all the right skillsets and opportunities that only lacked the capital to scale and execute. By partnering with Sandbrook and PSP, we can provide the financing and sophisticated asset management NeXtWind requires to become successful.</p>
