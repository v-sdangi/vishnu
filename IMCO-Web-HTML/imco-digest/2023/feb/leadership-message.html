		<p><strong>Delivering Client Success is at the core of IMCO's mandate</strong><br>
		<p>Welcome to the February edition of the IMCO Digest.</p>
	    <p>2023 is off to a running start with the recent launch of our <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/five-year-strategic-plan.html" target="_blank">Five-Year Strategic Plan</a> as shared in Bert's Leadership message in January. This plan is guided by our mission and fundamental purpose to deliver long-term investment outcomes to support the achievement of our clients' objectives. With emphasis on our Client Success Pillar, we will continue to focus on deepening our long-term partnerships with clients through an aligned, efficient, and proactive engagement and service model. </p>
		  
	    <p>An important feedback mechanism for IMCO is our annual client survey. I am pleased to share that IMCO's client satisfaction scores trended upwards across client and survey categories in 2022. Listening to client feedback over recent periods, IMCO made real progress and improved satisfaction within the areas of financial reporting and related services, in addition to ongoing enhancements to communication and engagement. Areas of strengths identified in the survey include strategic asset allocation (SAA) advisory, strategic research and insights, progress within our ESG initiatives, and depth of investment and risk expertise and capabilities. </p>
		  
	    <p>Throughout February, the Client Relationship Management (CRM) team hosted interactive dialogues with clients to further discuss their experience over the past year. These collaborative dialogues will be used to continue to build toward future enhancements and will inform our 2023 Client Experience Action Plan of near-term priorities, including:   </p>
		  <ol>
			  <li>Strengthening our role as a trusted advisor</li>
			  <li>Implementing the client research insights framework</li>
			  <li>Fostering a client-focused mindset across IMCO</li>
			  <li>Enhancing delivery and alignment with clients through implementation of a financial reporting services (FRS) framework</li>
		</ol>
		  
	    <p><strong>Strengthening our role as a trusted advisor</strong></p>
	    <p>We believe that strategic asset allocation (SAA) is the most important determinant of absolute return outcomes.  We strive to provide clients with thoughtful SAA advice that leverages our deep expertise and is informed by robust research, coupled with specific knowledge of individual client circumstances and objectives.
</p>
		  <p>As we manage all assets for our clients as an exclusive investment manager, we are uniquely positioned to offer asset mix advice that can optimize returns and support achievement of our clients' financial obligations within targeted risk/return objectives.</p>
		  
		<p><strong>Implementing the client research insights framework</strong></p>
	    <p>We believe that sharing strategic insights with our clients creates value and a more holistic understanding of IMCO's advice and investment activities. Actionable insights and timely research enable our clients to interpret investment trends, to support sound fiduciary decisions in an increasingly complex world. </p>
<p>Our comprehensive <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/news-insights/publication-reports/imco-world-view-jan-2023.pdf" target="_blank">World View (PDF)</a> defines the trends that we believe will have the most impact on our clients' portfolios. Our recently released research report about the changing geopolitical dynamic between the <a href="/pdf/research/imco-research-report-navigating-the-us-china-rivalry-public.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. and China (PDF)</a> provides further insights about how we manage portfolios and factor in a range of considerations when forming investment decisions. We look forward to presenting thought leadership pieces on a range of views of critical issues facing investors.   
</p>

		<p><strong>Building a client-focused mindset at IMCO</strong></p>
	    <p>Our people are our most valuable asset, and culture is the glue that effectively enables the attraction, retention, and development and growth of key talent.</p> 
		  <p>
In 2022 IMCO launched an enterprise-wide learning initiative to train all employees on the fundamentals of client success. With 100 percent course completion and a high degree of cross-functional engagement in practice workshops, IMCO's organizational culture is firmly established in our common goal of client success. 
</p>
<p>This year we will advance initiatives and practices that will foster and further deepen our client focus.</p>
		  
		<p><strong>Implementing the Target Financial Reporting and Services (FRS) Framework</strong></p>
	    <p>IMCO has made progress in working with our clients on an aligned framework and scope of services in the area of financial reporting. Our focus this year will be on continuing to implement the target FRS framework including streamlining processes to further improve efficiencies, enhancing delivery of timely and high-quality reporting support, and aligning scope and service expectations.
</p>
		  <p>We will deliver client success across all strategic pillars as we leverage our advantages as an investor to create value for our clients. </p>
<p>I invite you to learn more about IMCO's <a href="https://www.imcoinvest.com/five-year-strategic-plan.html" target="_blank">Five-Year Strategic Plan</a>.
