		  <p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Q&amp;A with Rossitsa Stoyanova on IMCO's ESG activities and progress</span></strong></p>
		  
		<p>On September 28, IMCO released our 2022 Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) report. This month, Rossitsa Stoyanova, Chief Investment Officer, describes IMCO's approach to ESG in 2023, our plan to reach net zero, and why IMCO is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that emerge from investing in climate solutions. </p>
		  
		 <p><strong>1. The past year has been a challenging one for investors. How is IMCO thinking about ESG in 2023?</strong></p>
		  <p>We are firm in our belief that ESG and climate change are essential considerations in achieving strong investment returns, and the past year has only confirmed our resolve. We see several trends within this realm affecting the investment landscape, including deglobalization and decarbonization. While these trends may lead to short term volatility in financial markets, we see ESG risks and opportunities as critical inputs to building resilient portfolios for the long term. </p>
		  <p>We continue to evolve our approach to ESG and have set our climate targets, which we will use to measure our progress in the short and long term. Our Climate Action Plan demonstrates our strong commitment to the decarbonization of our portfolio and includes a commitment to invest in climate solutions across our asset classes. </p>
		  
		  
		  <p><strong>2. How does IMCO's emission intensity reduction target affect its investment approach? </strong></p>
		  <p>Setting our climate targets was the culmination of a dialogue with each investment team. This bottom-up approach led to each asset class setting its own emission intensity reduction target - and owning the steps required to achieve it. Using this approach has helped us better understand how each asset class will contribute to IMCO's net zero target. </p>
		  <p>Our investments in real assets are our first areas of focus as they are relatively carbon intensive compared to other asset classes. Reducing absolute emissions in these sectors will be essential for the economy to transition to net zero and for IMCO to meet our climate objectives. In real estate, we are focused on investing in green and low carbon buildings that are more energy efficient, resilient to climate risks and attractive for tenants. In infrastructure, decarbonization is core to our investment thesis. With each investment we assess transition plans to the low carbon economy and understand how the investment will contribute to the energy transition. We believe these investments will help us reach our climate objectives and result in better returns in the long term. </p>
		  
		  <p><strong>3. What do you see as the biggest challenges and the most significant opportunities as IMCO advances its overall approach to ESG?</strong></p>
		  <p>Availability of good data continues to be a challenge. This includes systematic ways to measure the greenhouse gas emissions for all assets in our portfolio. We have a growing need to source accurate and timely information to support our decisions. </p>
		  <p>At the same time, we see a generational opportunity for investing in climate solutions. We believe the move away from fossil fuels will require a sizeable amount of capital and create significant opportunities for investors. As an innovative and nimble investor, we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities while advancing a more sustainable economy and future.</p>
