		  <p><strong><span style="font-size:18px">Behind the Exit: IMCO realizes a return of three times our invested capital upon sale of VersaCold</span></strong><br>
			  
	    <p>IMCO Private Equity (PE), alongside strategic partner TorQuest, successfully sold VersaCold to Lineage Logistics. During our ownership, we partnered with TorQuest and VersaCold's management to execute several strategic initiatives, which proved to be key value creation drivers, with IMCO realizing a return of three times our invested capital upon exit.</p>
		  
	    <p>IMCO's Principal in Private Equity, Shawn Lee, reflects on what happened and takes us behind the scenes:</p>
		  <p><strong>Let's start from the beginning. Who is VersaCold?</strong></p>
	   		  <p>Headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario, VersaCold is Canada's largest provider of warehousing and logistics services for temperature-sensitive products, with a 34% market share (at the point of entry). VersaCold's operations are comprised of cold storage warehousing and refrigerated transportation services. VersaCold provides cold storage and other value-added services primarily to food producers from a network of 24 refrigerated warehouses. VersaCold is the only nationwide operator with facilities across 7 provinces strategically located near key markets, including Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, and Edmonton.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p><strong>How did we first come across this deal, and what made it stand out to us? </strong></p>
		  <p>The deal was introduced to us by our strategic partner, Toronto-based TorQuest, in December 2020.</p>
		  <p>Favourable industry tailwinds, leading competitive positioning, stable and re-occurring revenue, diversified customer base, and attractive entry valuation (VersaCold previously experienced a broken auction) were all factors which made VersaCold a prime candidate for investment.</p>
		  <p>Coupled with TorQuest's strong track record in logistics businesses, we were confident that together we could create significant shareholder value by executing pre-identified value creation initiatives and building a unique asset desired by strategic and financial buyers upon realization.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>Tell us about IMCO's relationship with TorQuest. Why did they choose to partner with us on this deal? </strong></p>
		  <p>We were able to leverage our existing relationship with TorQuest, having previously completed a co-investment of Can-Art in 2016 together, as well as a previous commitment to TorQuest Fund V. IMCO was able to distinguish itself from other TorQuest limited partners' due to our ability to quickly assemble an experienced deal team to co-underwrite the transaction, our ability to offer a sizeable amount of capital with a high degree of certainty to ensure TorQuest could close the deal, and our proven collaborative partnership approach.</p>
		  <p><strong>Together with TorQuest, what operational or strategic changes did we make to VersaCold? How did these improvements contribute to its growth or value creation?</strong></p>
		  <p>Upon acquisition, a key strategic move we made was to purchase several of VersaCold's leased real estate with then-owners H&amp;R REIT, which simplified and improved the risk-profile of the business for potential future buyers. At the time, we knew Lineage Logistics, the world's largest cold storage player, had their eye on VersaCold and its underlying real estate.  We also knew Lineage Logistics was on an acquisition spree with the intention to IPO (Initial Public Offering).</p>
		  <p>VersaCold's operational efficiencies were also improved, including streamlining the organizational structure, leading to reduced operating expenses. Further, efforts were made to improve revenue by leasing underutilized space to new clients, optimizing and standardizing pricing structures, and increasing the proportion of fixed, longer-term contracts. The management team was bolstered with new appointments, including installing a new CFO. Lastly, we initiated and advocated for the inclusion of ESG measurements in the company's compensation program to advance various emission reduction and energy efficiency initiatives.</p>
		  
		  <p><strong>When IMCO decided to exit the deal, what made it the right time?</strong></p>
		  <p>Continuous dialogue with potential buyers (which included Lineage Logistics) gave us signals as to a ripe time to exit. After we completed several value creation milestones, such as the acquisition of real estate and other improvements, we knew it was the right time to begin the auction process.</p>
		  
		<p><strong>How did the exit process go? Were there any standout moments that maximized the deal's value?</strong></p>
		  <p>The exit process was facilitated by Wells Fargo, who, alongside TorQuest and IMCO, identified potential buyers. To maximize exit value, a competitive auction was orchestrated, even though there was a clear inclination towards a specific buyer - Lineage Logistics. This competitive dynamic, coupled with a structured and efficient sales process, ensured a robust valuation in our favor.</p>
		  
		<p><strong>After completing this deal, what are some key takeaways or learnings that might help us in the future?</strong></p>
		  <p>The success of this deal underlined the importance of the partnership model in PE. The ability to act quickly, maintain relationships with potential buyers, and set clear value creation strategies from the onset proved pivotal.</p>
		  <p>In addition, being a reliable co-underwriter, maintaining active involvement (as opposed to a passive role), and fostering a robust screening process to identify and work with the right partners are key differentiators for us.</p>
		  <p>We learned that setting the stage right at the beginning - selecting the right partners and aligning goals - is crucial for success.</p>
