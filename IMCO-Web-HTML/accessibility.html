                Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”) is committed to providing a
                barrier-free environment for clients and customers and to providing our goods and
                services in a manner that respects the dignity and independence of people with
                disabilities. The objective of this policy is to ensure that IMCO is compliant with
                the customer service requirements of the Accessibility for Ontarians with
                Disabilities Act, 2005 (the “AODA”).
              </p>
              <p>
                The purpose of this policy is to outline responsibilities of Covered Persons1 who
                deal with the public or other third parties on behalf of IMCO in providing services
                to people with disabilities in compliance with the AODA.
              </p>

                IMCO strives at all times to provide its services in a way that respects the dignity
                and independence of people with disabilities. We are also committed to providing
                people with disabilities the same opportunity to access our services and allowing
                them to benefit from the same services, in the same place and in a similar way as
                other customers.
              </p>
              <h3>1.1 Providing Services to Persons with Disabilities</h3>
              <p><strong>Principles</strong></p>
              <p>
                IMCO will ensure that this policy and any related practices or procedures are
                consistent with the following core principles:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  (a) <strong>Dignity</strong>: people with disabilities should be treated as valued
                  clients and customers who are as deserving of effective and full service as other
                  clients and customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (b) <strong>Independence</strong>: services must be provided without the control
                  or influence of others, and the freedom of people with disabilities to make their
                  own decisions must be respected.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (c) <strong>Integration</strong>: people with disabilities must be able to benefit
                  from services or products in the same place and the same or similar manner as
                  other clients and customers, whenever possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (d) <strong>Equality of Opportunity</strong>: people with disabilities must be
                  given an opportunity equal to that given to others to obtain, use and benefit from
                  services
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Policy</strong></p>
              <p>
                IMCO is committed to excellence in serving all of its clients and customers,
                including those with disabilities, and will do so in the following ways:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  1. <strong>Communications</strong>: We communicate with people with disabilities
                  in ways that take into account their disability. IMCO currently employs the
                  following mediums of accessible communication: telephone, online/virtual
                  communication, and email. We will train Covered Persons who
                </li>
                <li>
                  2. <strong>Telephone services</strong>: We will train Covered Persons to
                  communicate with customers over the telephone in clear and plain language and to
                  speak clearly and slowly. We offer to communicate with customers by e-mail.
                </li>
                <li>
                  3. <strong>Assistive devices</strong>: We are committed to serving people with
                  disabilities who use assistive devices to obtain, use or benefit from our
                  services. We will ensure that Covered Persons are trained and familiar with
                  various assistive devices that may be used by customers with disabilities while
                  accessing our services. The following assistive devices are available on our
                  premises for our customers: accessible washrooms and automatic doors.
                </li>
                <li>
                  4. <strong>Use of service animals and support persons</strong>: We are committed

                  the parts of our premises that are open to the public and other third parties. We
                  will also ensure that all Covered Persons dealing with the public are properly
                  trained in how to interact with people with disabilities who are accompanied by a
                  service animal. Every attempt will be made to ensure that any offsite event venues
                  are compliant with IMCO’s commitment regarding service animals.<br />
                  We are committed to welcoming people with disabilities who are accompanied by a
                  support person. They will be allowed to enter IMCO’s premises or offsite event
                  venues with his or her support person. At no time will a person with a disability
                  who is accompanied by a support person be prevented from having access to his or
                  her support person while on our premises or premises operated by IMCO for event
                  purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  5. <strong>Notice of Temporary Disruption</strong>: IMCO will provide customers
                  with notice in the event of a planned or unexpected disruption in the facilities
                  or services usually used by people with disabilities. This notice will include

                  description of alternative facilities or services, if available.
                </li>
                <li>

                  Persons, and all those who are involved in the development of IMCO’s policies,

                    IMCO has provided individualized workplace emergency response information to
                    Covered Persons with disabilities, if the disability is such that the
                    individualized information is necessary and IMCO is aware of the need for
                    accommodation. Personalized emergency response information is to be reviewed
                    whenever the Covered Persons with disabilities moves to a new work location,
                    when the overall accommodation information is reviewed or altered, or whenever
                    IMCO reviews its general emergency response policies.<br />
                    <br />
                    IMCO shall put in place a process for the creation of individual accommodation
                    plans for those Covered Persons that have a disability. This process shall be
                    implemented by:
                  </p>
                  <ol>

                      development of their accommodation plan and what the plans may include;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      b) establishing the means by which the Covered Person is to be assessed, and
                      the manner in which IMCO can request an evaluation by an outside medical or
                      other expert;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      c) establishing where the plans will be stored and what steps will be taken to
                      protect the privacy of Covered Person information; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      d) determining when and how the individual accommodation plans will be
                      reviewed and updated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      e) providing the individual accommodation plan, and the reasons for any denial
                      of the individual accommodation plan, in a format that takes into account the
                      Covered Person’s accessibility needs due to disability.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    IMCO shall develop and put in place a documented return to work process for
                    those Covered Persons that have been absent from work due to a disability and
                    require disability-related accommodation in order to return to work. This
                    process shall outline the steps that IMCO will take to facilitate the return to
                    work of the applicable Covered Persons and the use of individual documented
                    accommodation plans.<br />
                    <br />
                    IMCO will ensure that it takes into account the accessibility needs of Covered
                    Persons with disabilities (as well as their individual accommodation plans) when
                    implementing its performance management process. This will be achieved by:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      a) reviewing an individual’s accommodation plan to understand their needs and
                      determine whether it should be adjusted to improve job performance;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      b) providing performance-management related documents in accessible formats;
                      and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      c) providing informal and formal coaching and feedback in a manner that takes
                      in account an employee’s disability.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    IMCO will take into account the accessibility needs of its Covered Persons with
                    disabilities (as well as their individual accommodation plans) when providing
                    career development, advancement, or redeployment. This may occur through the
                    consideration of what accommodations Covered<br />
                    <br />
                    Persons with disabilities may need to succeed elsewhere within our organization,
                    to take on new responsibilities in a current role, or when redeployment has
                    become necessary.

                  <br />

                  public spaces, as defined in the Design of Public Spaces Standard. However, should
                  it choose to do so, this policy and plan will be revised to include the
                  requirements thereunder and how we will achieve compliance.

                  will endeavour to identify and remove accessibility barriers going forward.
