              The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) announced today that Kevin
              LeBlanc has been appointed its inaugural Chief Operating Officer, effective October

              Mr. LeBlanc is a former executive with TD Bank, where he spent more than 20 years in
              progressively senior asset management roles. As Chief Operating Officer with TD Asset
              Management Inc., he oversaw trading for equity, fixed income, currency and derivatives
              and led the organization’s development of indexed products and liability-driven
              investing methodologies. He also guided the integration of one of TD’s investment
              subsidiaries in the United States. Most recently, Mr. LeBlanc was Managing Director of

              “Kevin brings deep experience in driving operational excellence within complex
              investment firms,” said Bert Clark, President and CEO. “Creating a world-class
              operations team is critical, as we strive to be the investment partner of choice for
              public funds in Ontario. Kevin’s extensive background makes him the clear choice to
              move us forward.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. LeBlanc will manage IMCO’s operations and will develop a plan that supports the
              firm’s long-term growth and evolution. He will oversee the effective integration and
              deployment of key functions across the organization, including Information Technology,
              Investment Finance and Operations, and Strategic Development and Project Management.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. LeBlanc has an MBA from the Rotman School of Management at the University of
              Toronto and has received undergraduate degrees in Business and Computer Science, both
              from the University of New Brunswick. He also holds a CFA designation and is a member
              of the Investment Committee at the University of New Brunswick and the Vice Chair of
