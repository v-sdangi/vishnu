              TORONTO, Feb. 6, 2020 – Carttera Private Equities Inc. (Carttera) announces a major,
              long-term, downtown Toronto office leasing transaction at 65 King East, which will be
              home to Google, occupying 400,000 sf of office space across 18 floors in Toronto’s
              newest, next-generation office development.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are extremely pleased to announce that 100% of the office floors of 65 King East
              are now leased to Google: one of the most prominent, influential and well-recognized
              companies in the world. Our vision for 65 King East has always been to combine
              innovative office architecture and an employee-centric workplace design with a
              dynamic, forward-thinking organization. Google truly recognizes how 65 King East
              promotes sustainability, employee wellness, collaboration, productivity and health,”
              said Dean Cutting, Partner, Carttera. “The fact that Google made a long-term
              commitment to our project is a testament that we are leading the future of innovative
              office design. We look forward to a long-term collaborative relationship with Google
              for many years to come.”
            </p>
            <p>
              65 King East is owned by Carttera in conjunction with institutional co-investors:
              OPTrust, Manitoba Civil Service Superannuation Board and Investment Management
              Corporation of Ontario, which will be the long-term holders of the asset. The
              development’s design is a collaboration between world-renowned architects IBI Group
              and WZMH Architects. 65 King East is currently being built by PCL Construction.
              Google’s tenancy is a consolidation and relocation of offices in the Greater Toronto
              Area, with occupancy expected in 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Carttera built 65 King East with next-generation tenants and an evolving downtown
              core in mind,” said Jeff Friedman, Executive Vice President Office Leasing, CBRE.
              “Google’s decision to make 65 King East its new Toronto headquarters underscores the
              degree to which Toronto’s downtown core continues to expand. This is a significant
              statement of confidence in Toronto’s tech market and talent pool.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Together with the efforts of CBRE, this significant transaction is a great match for
              the growing downtown core, bringing innovation and tech giants into the fold of
              Toronto’s tight office real estate market. With proximity to the TTC and Union
              Station, this office building also features over 18,000 sf of outdoor terraces, 196
              bike stalls and 10,675 sf of retail space, while also incorporating smart building
              technologies and sustainability. With Wired Score Gold already accomplished, 65 King
              East has been designed to achieve LEED Gold certification.
