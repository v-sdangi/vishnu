              Cadillac Fairview (CF) and the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (on behalf
              of its client Ontario Pension Board) announced today that TD Bank Group (TD) has
              signed a long-term lease agreement, which will see TD occupy 840,000 square feet
              across 33 floors at 160 Front Street West. As part of the transaction, which remains
              subject to customary closing procedures, TD will take part ownership in the building.
              For TD, the investment is a strategic decision that reflects the bank’s strong balance
              sheet as well as the long-term outlook for corporate real estate in the downtown core.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are pleased to announce that 160 Front Street West is now 100 per cent leased.
              Closing out our leasing efforts with our long-standing partner, TD, is a significant
              occasion for our two companies,” said Wayne Barwise, Executive Vice President,
              Development, Cadillac Fairview. “Together, in 1967 CF and TD took a bet on the Toronto
              skyline with the opening of Toronto-Dominion Centre, forever changing the intersection
              of King and Bay Streets. I’m thrilled that over 50 years later we continue to
              collaborate, grow and innovate together.”
            </p>
            <p>
              With a significant presence in the new tower, TD has an opportunity to play a unique
              role in its design and construction. This partnership with Cadillac Fairview will give
              TD the ability to shape the vision of the interior workspaces and employee
              environments to drive colleague collaboration and improved workflow across the
              organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s not every day that an organization has the chance to design, from the ground up,
              a new kind of workplace,” saidPaul Whitehead, SVP Enterprise Real Estate, TD. “The
              tower at 160 Front Street West will create a free range, open concept campus
              experience, and reimagine the work experience for our colleagues. This is a key part
              of our GTA real estate strategy to transform the way our employees work, and updates
              to support this are already underway at many of our locations in downtown Toronto,
              including our flagship TD Centre.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Designed by world renowned Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture, in collaboration
              with B+H Architects as the Architect of Record, the building is slated to open in the
              fall of 2022. TD joins the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan as major tenants of the
              building.
            </p>
            <p>
              With close proximity to the City’s main transit hub, the office tower features 1.2M
              square feet of premium office space across 46-storeys, 339 parking stalls, 492 bicycle
              stalls, and 12,290 square feet of retail space. Incorporating the latest in smart
              building technology, 160 Front Street West is designed to achieve LEED® Platinum and
              WELL Building Standard® certifications. Further, once operational, the building will
              be subject to the standards of CF’s award-winning sustainability program, Green at
              Work®.
            </p>
            <p>
              “This project is indicative of our commitment to generating strong results over the
              long term for our clients through acquiring and developing high-quality assets,” said
              Brian Whibbs, Managing Director of Real Estate, IMCO. “This is possible when we work
              with strong and valuable partners like Cadillac Fairview.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Cadillac Fairview currently has $1.5B of major office projects under development,
              including the $479 million building at 16 Street in Toronto, which is a joint project
              with IMCO, the $200 million BMO Campus at CF Toronto Eaton Centre, and the $60 million
              revitalization of 2 Queen Street West in Toronto.
