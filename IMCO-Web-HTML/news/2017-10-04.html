              The Global Risk Institute in Financial Services (GRI) today announced the creation of
              a National Pension Hub (NPH) that will serve as a Canadian centre for pension
              knowledge and research. The purpose of the NPH is to provide pension and income
              security research that, among other things, will lead to innovative solutions to
              pension design, governance and investment challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              To date, more than a dozen organizations have joined the NPH, including major pension
              plans, accounting firms, consultancies and public corporations, as well as a number of
              individual opinion leaders in the field of pensions. Additional members are being
              recruited, including governments and companies associated with pension plans. The NPH
              will be administered by the GRI.
            </p>
            <p>
              “The diversity of our membership in the National Pension Hub is one of our key
              strengths,” said Barbara Zvan, Chair of the NPH, and Chief Risk & Strategy Officer at
              Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan. “It will help us produce innovative ideas and research
              that reflect a wide range of interests and perspectives.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The pension industry has been grappling with a number of evolving challenges over the
              past decade including an aging population with a longer life expectancy, finite
              resources to invest in, more complex regulations, greater market volatility, and the
              need to generate strong returns in a slower growth economy. The NPH will provide a
              pipeline of objective research on pensions and income security that will help pension
              plan providers, investment managers, policy makers, and government administrators
              address these and other challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
              In particular, the NPH will be an incubator for outcome-based research that addresses
              three primary objectives:
            </p>

            <ul class="a-list--unordered">
              <li class="a-list__item">
                Provide Innovative solutions to retirement saving challenges;
              </li>
              <li class="a-list__item">Create sustainable capacity for academic research; and,</li>
              <li class="a-list__item">Serve as an unbiased source for policy consultation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              “We plan to build a deep reservoir of pension knowledge and research that will inform
              pension industry stakeholders, encourage debate on pension policy, and lead to
              consensus on critical issues,” said Richard Nesbitt, CEO of GRI. “At GRI, we’ve
              developed a proven model of how to create value from research by working with academic
              and industry leaders. We want to apply this model of thought leadership to the pension
              industry.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The NPH’s first meeting will take place at the beginning of November, at which time it
              will set its initial research topics and projects. Most projects will have a two-year
              time horizon with interim reports delivered after the first year.
            </p>
            <p>
              The member organizations of the NPH at its launch date are: AIMCo, BCIMC, CDPQ, CPPIB,
              CN Rail, Deloitte University, IMCO, KPMG, McKinsey, Mercer, OMERS, OTPP, PSP, PwC and
              the GRI. Individual members who are pension experts include Hugh Mackenzie and Bob
              Baldwin.
