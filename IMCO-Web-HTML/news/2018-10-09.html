              The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) announced today that it has
              invested in Bioenergy Infrastructure Group (BIG), a UK-based firm that focuses on
              extracting energy from waste (EfW) through an aggregated platform. IMCO acquired its
              interest through a co-investment with Infracapital, a UK-based infrastructure
              investor. Infracapital, together with its investors, will hold majority control of
              BIG.
            </p>
            <p>
              EfW involves the treatment of waste that is processed into final products (i.e.
              energy, biogas, scrap metal, etc.) for either reuse, or as products which can then be
              landfilled. Following the various forms of treatment, the residual material can then
              be re-used or sold. BIG was established in 2015 with a view of creating a dedicated
              portfolio of EfW assets, targeting a generation capacity of more than 200MW.
            </p>
            <p>
              “This is an exciting opportunity for IMCO in an industry that is creating innovative
              solutions for renewable energy,” said Jean Michel, Chief Investment Officer of IMCO.
              “This investment aligns with our strategy to seek infrastructure opportunities with
              experienced, greenfield investors, while providing our clients with long-term, stable
              revenue generation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past decade, the UK government has set priorities to promote reuse and
              recycling as landfills there near capacity. BIG’s EfW facilities are well positioned
              to benefit from this waste treatment capacity gap and are strategically located across
              the country to meet the demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              BIG benefits from renewable energy incentives put in place by the government. The
              legacy Renewable Obligation scheme provides support for electricity generated from
              renewable sources and BIG receives renewable obligation certificates (ROCs), which
              energy suppliers can then purchase from BIG (equivalent to the amount of energy
              supplied). The firm also derives revenue from energy generation purchase agreements
              and gate fees, associated with its facilities that process refuse-derived fuels, and
              other ancillary sources.
