              Stoyanova replaces outgoing CIO Jean Michel and will lead world class investment team
            </p>
            <p>
              TORONTO (August 11, 2021) – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO)
              today announced that Rossitsa Stoyanova has been appointed as Chief Investment
              Officer, effective September 13, 2021. She reports to President & Chief Executive
              Officer Bert Clark and will be based in IMCO&apos;s Toronto office.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Stoyanova was most recently Managing Director and Head of Portfolio Design &
              Construction at CPP Investments, Canada&apos;s largest pension fund, where she also
              oversaw the fund&apos;s risk appetite and allocation. Prior to this, she was at GE
              Energy Financial Services in Stamford, Connecticut, where she was responsible for due
              diligence and structuring acquisitions in the power sector. She also worked in
              Assurance and Advisory Services at Deloitte & Touche in Chicago.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Rossitsa&apos;s investment expertise and depth in risk management, combined with her
              extensive expertise in portfolio design makes her uniquely positioned to be our Chief
              Investment Officer,” said Clark. “Her vision and approach will be a critical component
              to the ongoing creation of value for our clients and will be essential for IMCO growth
              and progress in the coming years.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Stoyanova&apos;s appointment follows outgoing CIO Jean Michel&apos;s decision to
              leave IMCO to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Michel&apos;s last day will be September
              10, 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I would like to thank Jean for his dedication and contributions over the past three
              years,” said Bert Clark, President & Chief Executive Officer. “Under his leadership,
              IMCO achieved critical milestones in executing its investment strategy and we are
              strongly positioned for the future.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Stoyanova will lead IMCO&apos;s senior investment team comprised of Christian
              Hensley, Senior Managing Director, Equities and Credit; Patrick DeRoy, Senior Managing
              Director, Total Portfolio and Capital Markets; Brian Whibbs, Managing Director, Real
              Estate; Tim Formuziewich, Managing Director, Global Infrastructure; and Hrvoje Lakota,
              Vice President, Portfolio Construction.
            </p>
            <p>
              “IMCO&apos;s mandate is both challenging and exciting and I look forward to being a
              part of the organization&apos;s next phase of growth,” said Ms. Stoyanova. “I am
              excited to join this dynamic team and to share my experiences with them as we work
              together to deliver long term value to our public-sector clients.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Stoyanova holds a BBA from Saint Mary&apos;s College in Indiana and an MBA from
              the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Illinois.
