              CORSAIR®, a world leader in high-performance PC components, gaming peripherals, and
              enthusiast memory, announced today that EagleTree Capital (“EagleTree”), formerly
              Wasserstein Partners, has reached a definitive agreement in partnership with current
              management to acquire a majority stake in CORSAIR from Francisco Partners and several
              minority shareholders.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of the transaction, CORSAIR founder and Chief Executive Officer Andy Paul will
              maintain a sizable equity stake in the company and continue in his role as CEO. IMCO
              (Investment Management Corporation of Ontario) and the Honeywell pension are also
              co-investing alongside EagleTree, which is acting on behalf of its private equity fund
              EagleTree Partners IV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Founded in 1994, CORSAIR has grown from a single performance memory product line into
              a leading global provider of high performance branded computer products, including
              memory, components, peripherals, and complete systems. The company&apos;s diverse
              portfolio of premium PC gaming products serves the high-growth PC gamer market, and
              the products are available through distributors and retailers in over sixty countries
              worldwide.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are excited about the opportunity to partner with EagleTree and leverage the
              team&apos;s consumer products expertise to further accelerate our progress,” said Andy
              Paul, Founder and CEO of CORSAIR. “We are very fortunate to have attracted such
              experienced investment partners. EagleTree&apos;s backing will allow us to continue to
              focus first and foremost on our loyal and passionate customers and accelerate our
              investment in innovation and new technology and products to enhance the quality
              experience that enthusiasts and gamers have come to expect from us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “This is a transformative time in the PC gaming industry. A rapidly growing global
              gamer population, together with the rise of eSports and streaming, has made PC gaming
              one of the world&apos;s most dynamic industries,” said George Majoros, Jr.,
              Co-Managing Partner of EagleTree. “CORSAIR is the undisputed leader in PC gaming
              hardware and has built a strong brand on a foundation of quality, innovation and an
              unwavering commitment to its passionate fans. We look forward to working with Andy and
              CORSAIR&apos;s talented management team to maintain the company&apos;s focus on
              innovative products, to expand into new markets, and to pursue selective
              transactions.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “It has been our pleasure to partner with Andy and the team at CORSAIR. They have
              built an incredible company and are well positioned for continued success,” said
              Andrew Kowal, Partner at Francisco Partners. “We wish the company and EagleTree all
              the best in their next chapter of growth.”
            </p>
