              New strategic partnerships add actively managed public credit to IMCO’s Global Credit
              portfolio
            </p>
            <p>
              TORONTO (April 25, 2022) – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) today announced that the weighted average net return of its clients’ portfolios was 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a consolidated benchmark return of 8.5%. Client returns ranged from 0.1% to 11.2%, reflecting broad differences in their respective asset allocation strategies, risk tolerances and investment objectives.</p>
            <p>IMCO generated 110 basis points of net value add for clients in 2021, and 50 basis points annualized since first launching its new investment strategies two years ago. IMCO’s assets under management rose to $79 billion at the end of 2021, up from $73.3 billion a year earlier.</p>
            <p>“We are proud of the results we achieved for our clients this year,” said Bert Clark, President and Chief Executive Officer. “IMCO’s outperformance reflects our fundamental approach to investing. We look to buy high quality assets at fair prices and focus on long-term value creation.”</p>
            <p>“We continue to work with our clients to build better performing asset mixes over the long-term,” Clark added. “This includes creating more access to private assets and introducing modest use of systematic leverage. Additionally, we have established new approaches to investing in each asset class with a more focused number of partners and an increased proportion of funds that are invested directly. I am pleased to see that these changes are already yielding improved absolute and relative (to benchmark) returns.”</p>
            <p>In addition to ongoing strategy refinement throughout 2021, IMCO increased its investing activities significantly, carrying out 35 direct and co-investment transactions throughout the year while achieving numerous milestones. For example, IMCO completed its first 100% acquisition (Pulse Clean Energy), its first participation in an IPO (Definity Financial), and its first take-private deal (AusNet Services).</p>
            <p>“We have the internal expertise and world-class partners in place to deliver the sustained and long-term returns our clients require,” said Rossitsa Stoyanova, IMCO’s Chief Investment Officer. “Our results speak to our focused approach, which includes a fundamental approach to investing at the individual security level, coupled with strong portfolio construction advice and management.”</p>

                <li>IMCO launched two new equity pools: the <a href="2022-02-11.html">Global Public Equity Pool</a> and the Emerging Markets Public Equity Pool. Combined with the Canadian Public Equity Pool, the three pools represent approximately $25.2 billion in AUM, offering new clients access to a range of public equity strategies.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Public Market Alternatives</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>IMCO launched the Public Market Alternatives Pool in 2021, combining assets and providing portfolio construction benefits and portfolio management efficiencies, as well as better liquidity management.</li>

              </ul>
			  <p><strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO ESG AND NET ZERO BY 2050</strong></p>
                <p>IMCO also made considerable progress on embedding ESG in its investing approach in 2021, reflecting the organization’s commitment to building a sustainable, low-carbon future and a stronger and more resilient global economy.
