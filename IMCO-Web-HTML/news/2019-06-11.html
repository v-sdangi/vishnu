            <p>
              The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) and Tishman Speyer today
              announced the creation of a joint venture established to build a valuable portfolio of
              new developments and repositioned office and multi-residential properties in major
              U.S. gateway cities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The planned investment program bolsters IMCO’s commitment to generating strong results
              for its clients through high-quality assets and developing long-term and mutually
              beneficial strategic partnerships. For Tishman Speyer, the venture will facilitate the
              expansion of its presence in major U.S. markets specifically by taking advantage of
              value-add opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              With IMCO’s initial commitment of $500 million (USD), and additional co-investment
              opportunities of $250 million (USD), IMCO and Tishman Speyer will jointly acquire and
              develop property in major supply-constrained U.S. markets. This includes New York,
              Washington, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle. Investments will
              target new development opportunities and well-located office and multi-residential
              assets in need of renovation – converting them into modern, class A properties.
            </p>
            <p>
              “IMCO has partnered with Tishman Speyer to leverage its worldwide presence, as well as
              deep local market knowledge,” said Jean Michel, Chief Investment Officer, IMCO. “This
              partnership allows us to access larger transactions where few bidders can compete.
              Tishman Speyer has a consistent track record in project delivery, which makes it an
              ideal partner for us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Tishman Speyer President and CEO Rob Speyer commented, “Demand is very strong for high
              quality office space and multifamily housing in U.S. gateway cities, and we believe
              that will be the case for the foreseeable future. This alliance will help to fuel our
              ability to help meet that demand, working with a partner that is financially well
              positioned and experienced in successful investment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO prefers to develop partnerships with full-service real estate organizations that
              offer competitive advantages including market knowledge, deal accessibility,
              best-of-breed in-house expertise and strong reputations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Targeted cities are characterized by supply constraints, which support higher rent
              growth as new developments lag demand. Market fundamentals across the U.S. remain
              strong and continue to outperform expectations. Development and value-add
              opportunities are economically attractive in the target markets, with stabilized
              return on cost at significant spreads over existing cap rates on core assets.
