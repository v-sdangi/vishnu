              TORONTO—April 13, 2021 – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) today
              announced that the weighted average return of its clients’ funds was 5.4% (net of all
              fees) for the year ended December 31, 2020. Client returns ranged from 0.2% to 7.1%,
              reflecting broad differences in their respective asset mixes, risk tolerances, and
              investment objectives. IMCO also met its consolidated return benchmark index for the
              year, as assets under management rose to $73.3 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We delivered solid results and met our benchmark, even as we implemented new
              investment strategies and managed through the volatile investment environment created
              by COVID-19,” said Bert Clark, President and Chief Executive Officer.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Our approach is disciplined. We focus on those things that generate better
              risk-adjusted returns for our clients over the long-term,” he continued. “That means
              avoiding large asset class over weights, ensuring adequate liquidity to navigate times
              of market stress, and managing costs effectively.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout 2020, IMCO introduced new strategies for each asset class, which led to a
              complete overhaul of certain categories, such as public equities and public market
              alternatives. Transforming other asset classes, including real estate, is underway.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Our clients are already benefiting from these new strategies,” said Clark. “For
              example, private equity and global credit both delivered double digit returns and
              significantly outperformed their benchmarks. Transforming our real estate portfolio
              will take longer.”
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO also focused its investment activities in 2020 by reducing its external manager
              roster by approximately half, eliminating costly fund-of-funds structures, and
              establishing new strategic partnerships.
            </p>
            <p>
              “There will always be external managers with unique investment capabilities, so we are
              actively building partnerships with those best-in-class investors,” said Clark. “We
              have also built internal capabilities that enable us to significantly reduce costs on
              behalf of our clients.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding the continued growth in internal investment, risk management, and
              enriched client service capabilities, IMCO exceeded its cost savings’ target for the
              year by 25% as it continued to provide its clients with tailored investment solutions
              and access to asset management capabilities, which they could not replicate on their
              own at the same cost.
            </p>
            <p>
