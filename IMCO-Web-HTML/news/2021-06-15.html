              TORONTO (June 15, 2021) – North York General Hospital (NYGH) is very pleased to
              announce that on June 14, 2021 Bert Clark was named the new Chair of NYGH’s Board of
              Governors. He takes over from outgoing Board Chair Samuel Elfassy, who ended his
              three-year term the same day.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It is a great privilege to serve our community as Chair of the North York General
              Hospital Board of Governors,” said Bert Clark, Chair of the NYGH Board of Governors.
              “I have the utmost admiration for the North York General team and our partners who
              have worked non-stop to provide the highest standard of care to patients throughout
              the pandemic. Guided by our new Strategic Plan, Thinking Beyond, NYGH will continue to
              work with our partners to make a difference to everyone we serve.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Bert’s tenure with the NYGH Board of Governors began in November 2016 when he served
              as a community member on the Board’s newly formed Capital Development Advisory
              Committee (CDAC). He was elected to the NYGH Board of Governors in June 2018 and
              served as the Board’s Vice-Chair this past year.

              “Bert is a passionate champion of NYGH and a visionary leader with vast executive
              experience in law, investment, public sector finance, and infrastructure,” said Karyn
              Popovich, President and CEO of North York General Hospital. “With Samuel’s steady
              leadership during an extraordinary time, NYGH is well positioned for the future. Now,
              with Bert at the helm, NYGH will continue to thrive and provide outstanding care to
              our vibrant, growing and aging population.”
            </p>

              Corporation of Ontario (IMCO), which manages $73.3 billion of assets and provides a
              range of investment management and advisory services to participating public sector
              organizations in Ontario. Prior to IMCO, Bert was the President and CEO of
              Infrastructure Ontario and held key executive roles in the financial sector.
            </p>
            <p>
