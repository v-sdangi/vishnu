              Today the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) began to manage the
              assets of its first two clients, the Workplace Safety Insurance Board (WSIB) and the
              Ontario Pension Board (OPB). Together the funds under management have a value of
              approximately $60B and are invested across a broad range of asset classes, including
              public equities, public debt, private equity, real estate, and infrastructure. This
              puts IMCO among the group of the largest public-sector asset managers in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO was established in 2016 and modelled after similar organizations in Canada such
              as AIMCo and bcIMC. IMCO&apos;s mandate is to provide broader public-sector clients in
              Ontario with exceptional investment management services, including best-in-class
              advice around portfolio construction, efficient access to a diverse range of asset
              classes and superior reporting on risks and returns.
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO is a member-based non-share capital corporation. It operates independently of
              government, consistent with best practice in the public pension fund investment
              sector. IMCO&apos;s Board of Directors is a professional board with expertise in a
              range of directly relevant areas. IMCO&apos;s CEO, Bert Clark who was hired in late
              2016 has been working with the WSIB and OPB to build the organization required to
              assume investment responsibility for the $60B of assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We look forward to working with our initial two clients and future clients in the
              coming years to provide them with value added investment services,” Bert Clark, CEO.
            </p>
            <p>
              “This is an exciting day for the group of people who have been working hard over an
              extended period to make IMCO a reality. The Board is confident that IMCO will have a
              major impact on public fund management in Ontario,” David Leith, Chair of the Board of
              Directors.
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO anticipates and looks forward to working with additional broader public-sector
              clients once the integration of the assets and operations of the first two clients is
              complete.
