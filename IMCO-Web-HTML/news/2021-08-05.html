              First-of-its-kind transaction for IMCO will establish a global, utility-scale battery
              platform
            </p>
            <p>
              TORONTO, August 5, 2021 – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”)
              announced today it has signed an agreement to acquire 100% of Green Frog Power Ltd.
              (“Green Frog”) and will invest up to $500 million (£288 million) over the next several
              years, to transform Green Frog into an owner and operator of utility scale batteries
              and execute on its pipeline of battery projects under development. The transaction
              will enable IMCO and Green Frog to establish a global, utility-scale platform focused
              on battery storage assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              “IMCO is actively seeking new and innovative ways to participate in the global
              transition towards a low-carbon future while accessing compelling returns for our
              clients,” said Bert Clark, President and CEO of IMCO. “This acquisition is an
              excellent example of this strategy in action and is tightly aligned with our ESG and
              sustainable investing objectives.”
            </p>
            <p>
              This transaction is the first time IMCO has acquired 100% of a company and it is a
              marquee addition to IMCO’s infrastructure portfolio. Green Frog was founded in 2009
              and is a leading developer, owner, and operator of flexible generation projects in the
              UK. It has developed a substantial pipeline of near-term development projects and the
              Green Frog team is highly regarded with extensive expertise in design, development,
              construction, and operations of flexible generation assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Over the past 12 years we have built Green Frog into a national leader in flexible
              generation,” said Jeremy Taylor, Founding Director at Green Frog Power. “We are
              excited to be working together to build a best-in-class scalable battery storage
              platform. IMCO’s acquisition enables us to continue to offer the UK market enhanced
              grid stability services.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Renewable energy that is generated intermittently, like solar or wind, can cause
              system instability and price volatility when it is introduced into a power grid. The
              UK is expected to be a global leader in the adoption of intermittent renewable energy
              over the coming decades and battery storage is uniquely positioned to help system
              operators navigate this challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Utility scale batteries play a critical role in greening electricity by providing
              grid operators with frequency stability solutions, which enable further renewable
              penetration growth,” said Tim Formuziewich, Managing Director of Global Infrastructure
              at IMCO. “The acquisition of Green Frog gives us access to a leading flexible
              generation platform and a substantial development pipeline in what we believe is the
              early stages of a trillion-dollar utility scale battery sector.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and
              approvals.
