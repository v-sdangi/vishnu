              <strong>TORONTO (November 21, 2022)</strong> – The Investment Management Corporation
              of Ontario ("IMCO") today announced its interim climate targets for 2030, consistent
              with science-based net zero pathways aimed towards the 1.5°C temperature goal of the
              Paris Agreement and net zero emissions by 2050.
            </p>
            <br />

            <ul style="padding-left: 40px">
              <li>
                <strong>An interim science-based target</strong> of 50% reduction in portfolio
                emissions intensity by 2030, as measured against IMCO’s 2019 baseline; and
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Investments in climate solutions</strong> totaling 20% of the portfolio by
                2030.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <p>
              "At IMCO, we believe that the global transition to a net zero economy will be one of
              the more powerful investment trends in the coming years. It will create material risks
              and opportunities for all investors, including our clients," said
              <a href="../executive-team/bert-clark.html" target="_blank">Bert Clark</a>, President
              and Chief Executive Officer, IMCO. "The targets we have set for 2030 reflect our
              pragmatic approach to helping our clients mitigate the risks and benefit from the
              opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy."
            </p>

            <p>
              IMCO has a plan to achieve these interim targets, taking action across all four areas
              of its <a href="../climate-action.html">climate strategy</a>:
            </p>
            <br />

            <p><strong>1. Capital Deployment</strong></p>

            <ul style="padding-left: 40px">
              <li>
                IMCO will increase its investment in climate solutions to 20% of IMCO's portfolio by
                2030. Climate solutions are defined in line with the categories detailed in the
                Green Bond Principles, as set out by the International Capital Markets Association
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>2. Portfolio Management</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMCO will:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px">

              </li>
              <li>increase investment in companies with net zero commitments</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>3. Asset Ownership</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMCO will:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px">
              <li>
                support its external managers and portfolio companies in establishing Paris-aligned

              </li>
              <li>
                engage with its external managers and portfolio companies to increase the share of
                its portfolio reporting emissions data
              </li>
              <li>
                exercise its right to vote at shareholder meetings, to encourage companies to manage

              <li>
                collaborate with like-minded investors and policymakers to drive collective climate
                action
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>4. Climate Guardrails</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMCO will:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 40px">

              <li>limit exposure to investments in thermal coal mining and arctic drilling</li>

            <br />
            <p>
              "IMCO's interim targets are built on a number of practices already followed by our
              investment teams, and consistent with all of our investment strategies," said
              <a href="../executive-team/rossitsa-stoyanova.html" target="_blank"
                >Rossitsa Stoyanova</a
              >, Chief Investment Officer, IMCO. "We are confident in our ability to achieve these
              targets, especially as we have already made significant investments in the energy
              transition. These interim targets will drive and guide investment decisions that both
              earn returns for our clients and make progress towards a low-carbon economy."
