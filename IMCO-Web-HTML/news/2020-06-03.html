              euNetworks remains focused on developing its network platform, with additional growth
              capital supporting the build of critical infrastructure in Europe.
            </p>
            <p>
              London, Toronto and New York (3 June, 2020) – euNetworks Group Limited (“euNetworks”),
              a Western European bandwidth infrastructure company, today announced that it has
              secured an additional €250 million of capital from the Investment Management
              Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”), an investor since 2018, alongside a new commitment
              from a vehicle managed by Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners. Pro forma for the capital
              raise, Stonepeak will continue to own a majority stake in euNetworks. The equity
              commitment will be allocated to fund further organic growth, M&A and other general
              corporate purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              euNetworks is focused on delivering high bandwidth data centre to data centre
              connectivity between and within cities in Europe. The company owns and operates deep
              fibre networks in 17 cities and also operates a highly differentiated long haul
              network that spans 15 countries. euNetworks continues to invest in its network,
              building unique routes, adding multiple diverse paths and extending reach into key
              hyperscale data centre sites, data centre clusters and network aggregation points.
              These investments continue to fuel the company’s growth and are driven by the capacity
              requirements of euNetworks’ customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Bandwidth and Internet Infrastructure underpins much of commerce and society and that
              impact continues to grow exponentially,” said Brady Rafuse, Chief Executive Officer of
              euNetworks. “We are laser focused on deploying capital to support the requirements of
              our customers, whose bandwidth requirements typically double every year. We are
              delighted to have secured additional investment from IMCO and Stonepeak and thank them
              for their support as we continue to build and deploy fibre network infrastructure in
              Europe.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “When we made our initial investment, we recognised that euNetworks had distinguished
              itself in an increasingly connected society where certain backbone fibre networks
              underpin the digital infrastructure ecosystem, said Brian McMullen, Senior Managing
              Director of Stonepeak. “That remains the case today, and the team continue to do an
              exceptional job, delivering critical network infrastructure to euNetworks customers.
              There continues to be no shortage of compelling capital opportunities in Europe and we
              remain committed to building further on the unique position of euNetworks.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We seek to invest in world class infrastructure businesses globally and are excited
              to be supporting one with our investment in euNetworks as they continue growth of
              their European platform,” said Tim Formuziewich, Managing Director and Global Head of
              IMCO’s Infrastructure program. “We see bandwidth demand growth being extremely
              differentiated to other value drivers of infrastructure assets that offers
              diversification to our clients’ portfolios. That growth profile combined with
              euNetworks’ leading position in the European bandwidth infrastructure market and track
              record of successful capital deployment presented a strong investment opportunity for
              IMCO.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In recent years, euNetworks has added new metro networks in Manchester, Milan, Madrid
              and Vienna, connecting all key data centres, as well as additional density and
              extensions to many of its existing city networks. The company has also extended its
              long haul network, adding unique routes, deploying new fibre on existing routes and in
              late 2019, completed the build out of critical Internet infrastructure linking Dublin
              to London and Lowestoft. This new

              (Rockabill), and the entire route was built with new ultra low loss fibre to deliver
