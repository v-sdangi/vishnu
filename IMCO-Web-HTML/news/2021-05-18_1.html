            <p>
              <strong>TORONTO (May 18, 2021)</strong> – The Investment Management Corporation of
              Ontario (“IMCO”) has closed its commitment with a new strategic partner, Ares
              Management Corporation (“Ares”) (NYSE: ARES). IMCO’s US$500-million commitment to Ares
              (the “Fund”) will provide its Global Credit asset class timely access to an actively
              managed, diversified multi-strategy credit portfolio. IMCO has allocated US$400
              million of its US$500-million to a Fund of One structure and US$100-million to Ares
              Pathfinder Fund, L.P. (together with its parallel vehicles, “Pathfinder”), a flagship
              global alternative credit fund. Pathfinder pursues a differentiated strategy of
              providing tailored financial solutions for owners of large, diversified portfolios of
              assets that generate predictable and contractual cash flows throughout market cycles.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ares’ 20-plus year track record, depth and breadth of capabilities and expertise
              across asset classes represents the kind of strategic partner we want as we grow our
              Global Credit portfolio,” said

                >Jennifer Hartviksen</a
              >, Managing Director, Global Credit, IMCO. “IMCO’s strategic partnership with Ares is
              well-aligned with our diversification strategy and enables our clients to gain global
              access to a wide spectrum of credit products and markets—both liquid and illiquid,
              public and private.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Ares is a leading global alternative investment manager operating integrated groups
              across Credit, Private Equity, Real Estate and Strategic Initiatives. With
              approximately 1,100 institutional investors, Ares manages capital for a variety of
              pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, university endowments, charitable foundations,
              financial institutions, and family offices. Pathfinder invests in alternative credit
              assets that are often sourced in the financing gaps found between the credit, private
              equity and real estate sectors.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are very excited to partner with IMCO and leverage our credit market leadership
              position to manage this strategic mandate,” said Michael Arougheti, Chief Executive
              Officer and President of Ares. “We designed this customized solution together with the
              goal of capitalizing on our all-weather approach to take advantage of opportunistic
              dislocations and market inefficiencies. We believe that this will provide IMCO with
              the flexibility to achieve their clients’ risk-reward objectives across both public
              and private markets.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed financing gaps in public credit segments for hard
              hit sectors seeking to address long-term solvency challenges,” added Hartviksen.
              “IMCO’s US$400-million commitment to the Fund of One, and our US$100-million
              commitment to Pathfinder positions us well to quickly respond to the demand for more
              bespoke capital solutions created by the current market and economic environment.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Created as a separate asset class in 2020, IMCO’s Global Credit portfolio invests
              across a range of public and private credit market segments including corporate, real
              estate, infrastructure, emerging markets, structured and IP royalties to generate
              higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional fixed income and additional
              diversification benefits to a total portfolio for Ontario public sector fund clients.
              The Global Credit team is differentiated by its cross-functional expertise, and
              clients and partners benefit from close internal coordination among IMCO’s public
              equities and private equity teams. As of December 31, 2020, IMCO’s Global Credit
              portfolio had CAD$4.6-billion AUM. The portfolio is expected to grow to CAD$8-billion
              or more by 2025.
