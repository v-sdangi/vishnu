              Toronto, Ontario – December 16, 2020 – TorQuest Partners (“TorQuest”) today announced
              it has completed the acquisition of VersaCold Logistics Services (“VersaCold” or the
              “Company”), one of Canada’s leading cold storage warehousing and food logistics
              companies, from KingSett Capital and Ivanhoe Cambridge. TorQuest is partnering on this
              transaction with The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”) and OPTrust
              to support the Company’s continued growth. Terms of the transaction were not
              disclosed.
            </p>
            <p>
              VersaCold’s management team, including Mike Arcamone, who has been elevated from
              President and Chief Operating Officer to CEO, will invest alongside the new investors
              and will continue to operate the business going forward. Mr. Arcamone succeeds Paul
              Campbell, who returns to his prior role with KingSett.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We welcome this investment and look forward to working with our new partners to
              capitalize on growing demand for cold storage logistics solutions,” said Mike
              Arcamone, CEO of VersaCold. “There will be no changes to the day-to-day operations as
              a result of the transaction and we remain fully committed to giving our customers the
              very best end-to-end supply chain solution available.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are excited to be partnering on this investment with the VersaCold team,” said
              Jonathan Fraser, a Partner at TorQuest. “VersaCold is an attractive business with
              significant growth potential, and we look forward to capitalizing on the company’s
              recent success by continuing to leverage its strategic locations, commitment to food
              safety and outstanding customer service.” This is the first platform investment for
              TorQuest Partners Fund V, a $1.375 billion fund that closed in March 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are proud of the work we have done to help establish VersaCold as an industry
              leader in Canada, with a strong management team and culture,” said Mr. Campbell. “We
              know the company is in good hands with Mike and his team, as well as the new investors
              – and we wish them success.”
            </p>
