              TORONTO (October 15, 2021) – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”)
              is pleased to act as a founding participant in the launch of Climate Engagement Canada
              (“CEC”), a finance-led initiative that aims to drive dialogue between the financial
              community and Canadian corporations to promote a just transition to a net zero
              economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CEC is a groundbreaking Canadian initiative, coordinated by several investor
              networks including the Responsible Investment Association (RIA), Shareholder
              Association for Research and Education (SHARE), and Ceres. The UN-backed Principles
              for Responsible Investment (PRI) is also supporting the program.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are thrilled to be part of this critical initiative because we recognize that real
              action on climate change will require robust and meaningful dialogue with the Canadian
              financial community and with Canadian Corporations,” said Rossitsa Stoyanova, Chief
              Investment Officer, IMCO. “At IMCO, we view climate change as both a systemic
              investment risk and an opportunity. We consider the potential impacts of the
              transition to a low-carbon economy and the physical impacts of different climate
              outcomes with the objective of delivering long-term value to our clients.”
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO is a signatory of the 2021 Global Investor Statement to Governments on the
              Climate Change Crisis, a statement signed by investors representing over USD $41
              trillion in assets, that calls on governments to set more ambitious emissions
              reductions targets, and enable greater access to how companies are assessing and
              managing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. IMCO also
              endorses the Canadian Investor Statement on Diversity & Inclusion, challenging
              investor institutions and Canadian companies to advance diversity and inclusion of
              underrepresented individuals to bring about a more inclusive investment landscape in
              Canada.
