              Dallas, TX, and Toronto, Canada – December 19, 2019 – Today, Lincoln Property
              Company’s residential division (“Lincoln Residential”) and its partner, Cadillac
              Fairview, as co-sponsor, announced the close of a US multifamily fund. With $800
              million in equity commitments from Lincoln Residential, Cadillac Fairview and the
              Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO), the fund will focus on the
              development and acquisition of high quality multifamily assets in top US markets. This
              long-term investment vehicle continues Lincoln Residential’s integration into the
              asset management business and furthers both Cadillac Fairview and IMCO’s goals of
              creating a diversified US multifamily portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tim Byrne, Lincoln’s Residential CEO stated, “We’re excited to continue our
              relationship with Cadillac Fairview and to establish a new one with IMCO. It’s an
              honor to partner with quality institutions that share our values and investment
              philosophy.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Chase Erickson, Lincoln’s Vice President of Investments, added, “Together with
              Cadillac Fairview and IMCO, we look forward to building a long-term portfolio of
              assets across the country. Our shared vision and surety of execution will allow us to
              compete for the highest quality multifamily opportunities in the market.”
            </p>
            <p>
              To date, the partnership has commenced two multifamily development projects, a
              254-unit community in Boston, Massachusetts, and a 374-unit community in Fort
              Lauderdale, Florida. The fund further anticipates starts in other major metropolitan
              centers early next year and is in the entitlement process on numerous development
              projects across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier this year, Lincoln Residential and Cadillac Fairview closed on a long-term
              strategic partnership, concentrating on the growth of multifamily property management
              operations and investments across the United States.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Building strong partnerships is central to the thesis of our strategy,” said Duncan
              Osborne, Executive Vice President, Investments, Cadillac Fairview. “We are thrilled to
              grow our business with a world-class partner like Lincoln Residential and have our
              existing partner, IMCO, invest alongside us in this exciting opportunity.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “IMCO is focused on creating long term value for its clients through strategic
              investment opportunities,” said Jean Michel, Chief Investment Officer, IMCO. “Working
              alongside exceptional leaders like Lincoln and Cadillac Fairview enables us to achieve
              this goal and aligns with our strategy of nurturing strong partnerships with leading,
              global real estate firms.”
