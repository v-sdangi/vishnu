              <em>Positive net value add of 0.4% generated over past three years, despite challenging market conditions</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>TORONTO (April 13, 2023)</strong> â€“ The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) today announced that the weighted average net return of its clients' portfolios was -8.1% for the year that ended December 31, 2022, compared to a consolidated benchmark return of -8.4%. IMCO generated 0.3 percentage points of net value add (NVA) in 2022. Since inception (or over the three years since assets have been managed according to IMCO strategies) the annualized return was 2%, compared to a consolidated benchmark return of 1.6%, representing 0.4 percentage points in net value add. IMCO's assets under management sat at $73.3 billion at the end of 2022.
		    </p>
			  
			  <p>IMCO's clients are public-sector entities, each with their own unique investment horizon and tolerance for risk. Therefore, their results are different both in absolute terms and NVA due to broad differences in asset mix and maturity of their respective strategies. The range of returns across IMCO's client portfolios was -9.1% to 1.6% in 2022.
			  </p>
			  
			  <p><strong>QUOTES</strong></p>
		    <p><em>"Although 2022 was the most turbulent year for markets in recent memory, we outperformed our benchmark and delivered added value for the third straight year, reaffirming the effectiveness of our long-term approach to helping clients build resilient portfolios," said <a href="/executive-team/bert-clark.html">Bert Clark</a>, <strong>President and CEO</strong> of IMCO.</em>
		    </p>
			  
			  <p><em>We witnessed an unusually large dispersion of returns across pension funds and asset managers in 2022, where funds with higher allocations to private assets typically posted higher returns," said <strong>Clark</strong>. "We continue to help many of our clients increase their allocations to private assets and to leverage their longer investment time horizon, as well as our strategic relationships and direct investment capabilities."</em>
			  </p>
				  
			  <p>
				  <em>"2022 was a challenging year and we were certainly disappointed in these returns. We remain focused on our strategy for navigating short-term turbulence by maintaining discipline in executing our long-term investment strategy, systematic rebalancing, and effective liquidity management to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from temporary dislocations," said <a href="/executive-team/rossitsa-stoyanova.html">Rossitsa Stoyanova</a>, <strong>Chief Investment Officer</strong> of IMCO.</em>
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  <em>"We continue to increase our private market exposure alongside our strategic partners, which was a huge returns' driver for us in 2022," said <strong>Stoyanova</strong>. "On the other hand, our absolute returns' performance was driven mainly by losses in public equities and fixed income, as both public markets and bonds took an unprecedented hit."</em>
			  </p>
			  <p>
				  <em>As we move forward, responsible investing and ESG integration will continue to play a growing role in our strategies. We believe that companies that strategically manage material ESG risks and turn them into opportunities will outperform their peers in the years to come and understand the importance making this a priority for IMCO," added <strong>Stoyanova</strong>.</em>
