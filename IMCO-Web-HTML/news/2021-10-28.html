              TORONTO (October 28, 2021) – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”)
              is investing US$500-million with Antares Capital LP (“Antares”), a leading provider of
              financing to mid-market private equity-backed companies in North America. IMCO&apos;s
              platform investment forms the foundation of the direct lending component of its Global
              Credit strategy and aims to build a diverse portfolio of sponsor-backed loans in the
              middle-market, focusing on U.S. and Canadian borrowers. The portfolio will be
              diversified across industry and sponsors and will target 75-100 issuers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Antares is a private debt credit manager and a leading provider of innovative
              financing and investment solutions for PE-backed borrowers and investors. With
              US$42.9-billion of capital under management and administration, it has one of the
              industry&apos;s largest and longest-tenured portfolios of mid-market companies. IMCO
              selected Antares as its private debt manager following a competitive process.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Private debt lending provides stable returns and aligns well with IMCO&apos;s
              tolerance for illiquidity and our long investing horizon,” said Jennifer Hartviksen,
              Managing Director, Global Credit, IMCO. “Antares has a 25-year track record investing
              across markets and industry cycles, and our new direct lending program will benefit
              from Antares&apos; broad suite of lending capabilities.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are very pleased to utilize our market leadership position and select access to
              high-quality private market investment opportunities to support IMCO in achieving
              their clients&apos; risk-reward objectives,” said Vivek Mathew, Head of Asset
              Management and Funding, Antares Capital. “IMCO is a like-minded, purpose-driven
              institution and we&apos;re proud to have customized a solution allowing their clients
              to capitalize on the growth we drive within the middle market.”
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO&apos;s Global Credit portfolio invests across a range of public and private
              credit market segments including corporate bonds and loans, real estate and
              infrastructure debt, off-balance sheet financing loans, emerging markets debt, high
              yield bonds and leveraged loans to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than
              traditional fixed income, adding diversification benefits to a total portfolio for
              IMCO&apos;s public sector clients. The Global Credit program is differentiated by its
              broad approach to portfolio construction, making strategic allocations to
              liquid/illiquid securities, geographies and across the risk spectrum. Our experienced
              team has decades of diverse experience investing across credit segments, geographies
              and at all stages of the credit cycle. As of December 31, 2020, IMCO&apos;s Global
              Credit portfolio had $4.6 billion AUM. The portfolio is expected to grow to $8 billion
              or more by 2025.
