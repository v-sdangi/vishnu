              Breakthrough Fund closes first investment to develop Enterprise Research Campus at
              Harvard
            </p>
            <p>
              TORONTO (April 29, 2021) – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”) announced
              it has closed its USD$325-million commitment to Breakthrough Life Science Property
              Fund (the “Fund”), which aims to develop and assemble a portfolio of Class A life
              science properties in leading technology centres throughout the U.S. The Fund’s first
              investment includes the proposed development of an Enterprise Research Campus (“ERC”)
              at Harvard University in Boston, amidst one of the busiest biotech hubs in the world.
              IMCO’s commitment comes as the life sciences sector is driving unprecedented

              innovation to save lives and address age-related chronic ailments associated with
              increasing life expectancy.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Strong demographic tailwinds and record-breaking funding and activity in life
              sciences have created fundamentally sound conditions for our commitment to the Fund,”
              said <a href="/investment-team/brian-whibbs.html">Brian Whibbs</a>, Managing Director,
              IMCO. “Adding exposure to this research sector is well-aligned with our strategy to
              diversify our Real Estate portfolio, and we expect these assets will create long term
              value for our clients.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fund will develop the first phase of the ERC, a 14-acre mixed-use development site
              preliminarily approved for 900,000 square feet of lab, hotel, conference, and
              residential uses. The project is directly adjacent to Harvard’s Business School and
              new Science and Engineering Complex, as well as their Innovation Lab and Pagliuca
              Harvard Life Lab.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Most existing life science property inventory is owned by long term holders, which
              makes the Fund a highly desirable and rare investing opportunity,” said Whibbs.
              “IMCO’s Fund commitment is the result of our valued partnership with Tishman Speyer.
              It is gratifying to advance cutting edge research alongside world-class partners,
              improving and saving the lives of many.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The Fund was created by Breakthrough Properties (“Breakthrough”), a life science real
              estate investment company that has been jointly formed by Tishman Speyer’s global real
              estate platform and with Bellco Capital, a firm focused on life science companies and
              investment, and has integrated and long-lasting relationships with pharmaceutical,
              biotech and research institutions. The venture has, in aggregate, raised over
              $1-billion in capital for the Fund and Co-investment. IMCO has been part of a joint
              venture investment program with Tishman Speyer since 2019.
