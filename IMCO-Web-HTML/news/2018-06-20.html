              The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) announced today that Jean
              Michel has been appointed Chief Investment Officer, effective July 3, 2018. He reports
              to President and Chief Executive Officer, Bert Clark and will be based in IMCO’s
              Toronto office.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Michel is the former President of Air Canada Pension Investments. In this role, he
              developed the investment strategy and oversaw all investment activities of Air
              Canada’s 14 pension plans. Under his leadership, the financial health of these plans
              was solidified to ensure long-term sustainability.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Jean is an exceptional leader who brings deep investment experience to IMCO,” said
              Bert Clark, President and CEO. “We are building an organization that will provide
              public funds in Ontario with world class portfolio construction advice, access to a
              diverse range of public and private investment opportunities as well as high quality
              risk management and reporting. Jean’s extensive background makes him a clear choice to
              lead our investment division.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “IMCO’s scale and mandate are exciting and I look forward to building a world-class
              organization that provides public sector funds in Ontario with exceptional investment
              management services,” said Mr. Michel. “We will operate at the forefront of thinking
              when it comes to investments.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Most recently, Mr. Michel was Executive Vice-President, Depositors and Total Portfolio
              at la Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, where he managed la Caisse’s service
              offering and depositors relationships, in addition to overseeing asset allocation and
              overall portfolio building activities. Previously, he held senior roles at Mercer,
              where he was Team Leader for Eastern Canada and Head of Strategic Investment Research.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Michel will lead IMCO’s investment team. He will design and oversee the firm’s
              global investment activities, which will include strong portfolio construction
              capability, a focus on better access to all asset classes and greater internalization
              of investment activities. He will also oversee IMCO’s pursuit of strategic
              partnerships.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Michel is an Associate of the Society of Actuaries and holds a Master’s degree in
              Finance and a Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Mathematics, both from Laval
              University. He is a member of the Investment Committee at the University of Montreal
              Pension Plan and a member of the Pension Policy Council at the C.D. Howe Institute.
