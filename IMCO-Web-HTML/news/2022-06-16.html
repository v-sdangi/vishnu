              New strategic partnerships add actively managed public credit to IMCO’s Global Credit
              portfolio
            </p>
            <p>
              TORONTO (June 16, 2022) – The Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (“IMCO”)
              today announced it has invested approximately US$1.0 billion with two leading global
              credit managers, forming the foundation of IMCO’s allocation to actively managed
              public credit, and enhancing our access to the structured credit and leveraged loans
              markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO is investing US$550 million with Loomis, Sayles & Co. (“Loomis Sayles”) and
              US$450 million with Beach Point Capital Management (“Beach Point”). Together, the two
              complementary managers will enable IMCO to increase its active allocations to
              investment grade debt, high-yield bonds, structured credit, and leveraged loans.
            </p>
            <p>
              “We’re excited to offer our clients a range of public and private credit investment
              opportunities under one roof, across the full risk spectrum,” said Jennifer
              Hartviksen, IMCO’s Managing Director of Global Credit. “Our global credit strategy
              allows us to be flexible in response to market opportunities, and the expertise of
              Loomis Sayles and Beach Point will make our program even more nimble and agile in
              pursuit of superior client returns.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Loomis Sayles and Beach Point each offer seasoned investment teams and rigorous
              approaches to portfolio construction, sector allocation, security selection, and risk
              management.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Loomis Sayles is honoured to bring our longstanding expertise in credit investing,
              deep research capabilities and integrated risk analysis to this new partnership with
              IMCO,” said Kevin Charleston, Chief Executive Officer of Loomis Sayles. “We are
              excited to offer IMCO’s clients exposure to diversified sources of income and
              attractive risk-adjusted return potential through our team’s active approach to
              multi-asset credit investing.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “We are thrilled to partner with IMCO, a leading Canadian asset manager we have long
              admired, to provide its clients with access to differentiated multi-sector credit
              investing capabilities,” said Sinjin Bowron, a Portfolio Manager at Beach Point
              Capital Management. “We look forward to bringing our expertise across high yield,
              leveraged loans and structured credit markets to IMCO’s platform and utilizing our
              flexible mandate to capitalize on the rapidly evolving opportunity set across these
              markets for the benefit of IMCO and its clients.”
            </p>
            <p>
              IMCO’s Global Credit portfolio invests across a range of public and private credit
              market segments, including corporate bonds and loans, real estate and infrastructure
              debt, off-balance-sheet financing, emerging markets debt, high yield bonds and
              leveraged loans to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than traditional fixed
              income, adding diversification benefits to a total portfolio for IMCO’s public sector
              clients. The Global Credit program is differentiated by its broad approach to
              portfolio construction, making strategic allocations to liquid/illiquid securities and
              geographies across the risk spectrum. Our team has decades of diverse experience
              investing across credit segments, geographies and at all stages of the credit cycle.
              As of December 31, 2021, IMCO’s Global Credit portfolio had CAD$6-billion AUM. The
              portfolio is expected to grow to CAD$8-billion or more by 2025.
