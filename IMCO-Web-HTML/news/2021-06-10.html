              This statement, coordinated by the seven Founding Partners of The Investor Agenda, is
              signed by 457 investors representing over USD $41 trillion in assets
            </p>
            <p>
              We stand at the beginning of a pivotal decade in which institutional investors and
              government leaders worldwide have the power to raise ambition and accelerate action to
              tackle the climate crisis. If we do not meet this challenge and change course
              immediately, the world could heat in excess of 3-degrees Celsius this century1 – far
              beyond the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit the global average temperature rise to
              no more than 1.5-degrees Celsius, which scientists say is necessary to avoid the worst
              impacts of climate change.
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve this common goal, we must work together to reduce global net carbon dioxide
              emissions by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 20302, with a dramatic reduction of all
              greenhouse gas emissions essential for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner.
              Key to this is ensuring government leaders support sustainable COVID-19 economic
              recovery efforts consistent with net-zero emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the world prepares to gather for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference
              of the Parties (COP26), we encourage all countries to significantly strengthen their
              Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) for 2030 and to ensure a planned transition
              to net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. While we recognize the differentiated
              responsibilities and respective capabilities of countries, we believe that those who
              set ambitious targets in line with achieving net-zero emissions, and implement
              consistent national climate policies in the short-to-medium term, will become
              increasingly attractive investment destinations. Countries that fail to do so will
              find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this shared global crisis, investors and governments each have a responsibility to
              act swiftly and boldly. Investors are taking climate action in line with The Investor
              Agenda, with more investors than ever before embedding net zero goals and strategies
              into their portfolio decisions, engaging companies to cut their emissions and calling
              on policymakers to deliver robust climate action. Investors are urgently seeking to
              decrease their exposure to climate risk as a core fiduciary duty and benefit from the
              opportunities associated with the transition to a net-zero emissions economy.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, our ability to properly allocate the trillions of dollars needed to support
              the net-zero transition is limited by the ambition gap between current government
              commitments (as set out in NDCs) and the emission reductions needed to limit global
              average temperature rise to 1.5-degrees Celsius. In addition, as owners of (or those
              representing owners of) companies, we need access to adequate information on how these
              companies are assessing and managing the risks and opportunities presented by climate
              change. Government policy has a critical role to play in increasing our access to and
              affirmative disclosure of such information.

              These gaps – in climate ambition, policy action and risk disclosure – need to be
              addressed with urgency.
            </p>
            <p>We, therefore, call on all governments in 2021 to:</p>

              <li class="a-list__item">
                Strengthen their NDCs for 2030 before COP26, to align with limiting warming to
                1.5-degrees Celsius and ensuring a planned transition to net-zero emissions by 2050
                or sooner.
              </li>
              <li class="a-list__item">
                Commit to a domestic mid-century, net-zero emissions target and outline a pathway

                carbon-intensive sector.
              </li>
              <li class="a-list__item">
                Implement domestic policies to deliver these targets, incentivize private

                through: robust carbon pricing, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies by set
                deadlines, the phase out of thermal coal-based electricity generation by set
                deadlines in line with credible 1.5-degrees Celsius temperature pathways, the
                avoidance of new carbon-intensive infrastructure (e.g. no new coal power plants) and
                the development of just transition plans for affected workers and communities.

              <li class="a-list__item">
                Ensure COVID-19 economic recovery plans support the transition to net-zero emissions
                and enhance resilience. This includes facilitating investment in zero-emissions
                energy and transport infrastructure, avoiding public investment in new
                carbon-intensive infrastructure and requiring carbon-intensive companies that
                receive government support to enact climate change transition plans consistent with
                the Paris Agreement.
              </li>
              <li class="a-list__item">
                Commit to implementing mandatory climate risk disclosure requirements aligned with
                the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations,
                ensuring comprehensive disclosures that are consistent, comparable, and
                decision-useful.

            <p>
              Strong policies, in line with limiting global warming to no more than 1.5-degrees
              Celsius, can accelerate and scale up private capital flows towards the net-zero
              transition. Full implementation of the Paris Agreement will create significant
              investment opportunities in clean technologies, green infrastructure and other assets,
              products and services needed in this new economy. In turn, investors can use capital
              allocation and stewardship to support sustainable activities that generate jobs and
              economic growth, transition away from carbon-intensive activities and increase
              resilience. We encourage governments to engage closely with investors to make sure
              these opportunities are fully realized.
            </p>
            <p>
              As investors, we are committed to working with governments to ensure policy mechanisms
              are developed and implemented to transition to a climate resilient net-zero emissions
              economy by 2050 or sooner.
            </p>
            <p>
              We urge all governments to step up their collective response to the climate crisis.
