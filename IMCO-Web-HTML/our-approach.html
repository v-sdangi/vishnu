            <h2>Client-Centric Approach to Portfolio Construction</h2>
            <p>
              At IMCO, we take a client-centric view on portfolio construction, built exclusively
              around your unique set of needs and requirements. This means we collaborate with your
              board, actuaries and external advisers, and we work diligently to understand the
              characteristics of your liabilities and financial objectives.
            </p>

            <p>
              We work closely with you to define investment objectives and to advise on a strategic
              asset allocation that optimizes expected returns, consistent with your risk appetite.
              This work is supported by dedicated portfolio construction and research teams. We
              consider asset classes and risk factors to construct durable portfolios that can adapt
              to potential long-term trends and market fluctuations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once we fully understand your requirements, we apply our expertise to analyze and
              construct a total portfolio using a full suite of traditional (and if needed,
              alternative) investment solutions that are supported by market-leading tools and risk
              management systems.

              <p>
                We work with clients to identify their investment objective, risk tolerance and
                constraints, forecasting long-term expected returns and risk. These inputs are
                incorporated in Asset Liability studies in Phase 2.

              <h3><span class="a-heading__prefix">Phase 2</span> Asset Allocation</h3>
              <p>
                Consistent with the long-term horizon of the Asset Liability study, we construct a
                strategic asset mix based on long term risk and expected return models. We assess
                the sensitivity of the resulting portfolio to different long-term assumptions,
                market shocks and stress tests. We develop alternative views of long-term capital
                market returns and risk to assess the robustness of the base case assumptions.
                Alternative asset mixes are analyzed, and stress-tests are designed to evaluate
                specific downside risk scenarios, such as higher inflation or short-term negative
                investment performance.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Now we translate the client asset mix determined in Phase 2 to IMCO products
                available to clients of all sizes. Given the expected long-term return of each
                product and investment strategy, we guide the transition of our clients’ original
                portfolio to an enhanced strategic asset mix that is consistent with the results in
                the Asset Liability study. The allocation to IMCO strategies remains consistent with
                our clients’ long-term investment objective and risk tolerance.

              We understand that our clients face a heightened demand for transparency by their

              of reports includes timely market and economic updates, quarterly performance recaps,

            <p class="a-type--xlarge">
              Cost matters. So, we strive to provide our clients with access to a sophisticated
              investment platform at a lower cost than they would have to incur to develop similar
              capabilities themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, we serve our clients on a cost-recovery basis and are focused on prudently
              managing our investment and operating costs. We want to preserve the cost advantage
              arising from economies of scale for our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Scale is a key driver of our ability to manage investing costs. Our size means we can
              enter strategic partnerships, co-invest and access investments directly in a manner
              that would be difficult for smaller funds. As a result, we can reduce overall costs
              associated with alternative investments for our clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our clients will incur costs of 2 basis points (estimated) to access dedicated asset
              allocation and risk management capabilities. For a $1-billion fund, without our scale,
              this same management and oversight team would add in the range of 60-80 basis points
              to their costs, which is not affordable for many clients.

              Since we began managing funds, our clients have saved over $14 million while enhancing
              capabilities (asset mix, risk management, direct investing and reporting) that they
              didn’t previously have, at no incremental costs, on an asset mix adjusted basis. These
              greater capabilities will enable us to increase their long-term risk-adjusted returns
              and generate significantly more savings.
