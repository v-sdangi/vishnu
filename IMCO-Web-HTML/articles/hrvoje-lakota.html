            <p class="a-type--italic">
              In an increasingly challenging market environment, particularly with respect to
              investment returns, it is important for asset managers to consider all the tools at
              our disposal. Total portfolio leverage is one of these tools.
            </p>
            <p class="a-type--italic">
              Leverage is most often thought of in terms of the risk that it adds to a portfolio.
              However, the properties it brings to a portfolio go beyond this. In this note we
              highlight how, when used judiciously, total portfolio leverage can be an attractive
              alternative to other methods when trying to achieve a required return on assets in our
              portfolios.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Total Portfolio Leverage?</h2>
            <p>
              On some level, most investments utilize leverage. Public and private equities
              incorporate it through the corporate debt that is inherent in the capital structure of
              most companies. Real estate and infrastructure are often financed through combinations
              of debt and equity.
            </p>
            <p>
              What these forms of leverage have in common is that they are non-recourse beyond the
              individual investment. As a result, understanding the risk and return implications is
              best done by analyzing the individual characteristics of each asset in the portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Total portfolio leverage, on the other hand, is different. It refers to leverage
              applied to the total portfolio rather than an individual asset. As a result,
              understanding its implications on expected returns and risks can only be done by
              looking at the behaviour of the total portfolio through different market conditions.
            </p>
            <h2>How to implement Total Portfolio Leverage</h2>
            <p>There are many ways that total portfolio leverage can be implemented.</p>
            <p>
              One way is through use of financial instruments such as futures, forwards, and swaps.
              These instruments can provide market exposure greater than the amount of capital
              invested, thereby generating leverage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another is through transactions such as issuance of bonds and commercial paper, or
              through the use of repurchase agreements. These transactions provide a source of cash
              that can then be invested in other assets. Bonds and commercial paper do it by simply
              borrowing. Repurchase agreements, or repos, take a slightly different approach whereby
              an asset (e.g., a government bond) is simultaneously sold to a counterparty with
              immediate settlement and bought back, at a slightly higher price, from that same
              counterparty but with settlement delayed until 3 or more months into the future. This
              provides cash that can be invested immediately while maintaining the original market
              exposure to the asset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Which of these approaches is appropriate in given circumstances will depend on various
              factors including the implementation costs, liquidity, resulting tracking error, as
              well as other applicable constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the current market environment, repos are one of the more cost-effective approaches
              to achieving total portfolio leverage for most institutional investors.

              Much of the focus on leverage relates to the amount of risk it adds to the overall
              portfolio. However, an equally important characteristic of leverage is that it adds to
              expected returns. As such, leverage can be a useful tool, especially considering some
              of real-world realities faced by portfolio managers.

            <h2>Doesn’t Leverage Simply Increase Risk?</h2>
            <p>
              Much of the focus on leverage relates to the amount of risk it adds to the overall
              portfolio. However, an equally important characteristic of leverage is that it adds to
              expected returns. As such, leverage can be a useful tool, especially considering some
              of real-world realities faced by portfolio managers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Institutional investors spend a lot of time thinking about their asset mix, the role
              different assets play in their portfolios, and how to optimize their market exposures
              to best meet their objectives. They also, by necessity, operate within constraints.
              Some of these constraints are risk based (e.g., keeping contribution or funded status
              volatility below a certain threshold). Others are return based (e.g., keeping expected
              returns at a level where the plan is sustainable).
            </p>
            <p>
              Often, the biggest constraint is the simple reality that the amount of assets
              available for investment is limited. This inevitably results in the need to make
              compromises. Every dollar of assets that is invested in a return-generating portion of
              the portfolio means that there is a dollar less to invest in the portion of the
              portfolio designed to provide downside protection, diversification, or to offset other
              risks (e.g., interest sensitivity of plan liabilities).
            </p>
            <p>
              Total portfolio leverage can mitigate these constraints. It increases the total amount
              of assets that is available for investment and by doing so, it allows investors to
              better meet their objectives. As an example, this could allow the investor to build a
              portfolio which, when levered, is expected to generate superior risk adjusted returns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of this, our general view is that total portfolio leverage can sometimes be a
              better way to achieve investment objectives than many of the alternatives, such as
              adding more risk assets to the portfolio; adding more illiquid assets to the
              portfolio; reducing diversification / pursuing more “alpha” within asset classes; or
              making a large bet on specific asset classes. Perhaps it is not surprising that large
              pension plans and other institutional investors have been using total portfolio
              leverage as part of their investment strategy for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having said the above, the use of leverage needs to be considered carefully, as it
              introduces certain risk into the portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the cost of leverage exceeds the returns of the assets into which borrowed funds
              are invested, it will detract value. This will happen in any period the portfolio
              assets earn negative returns.
            </p>
            <p>
              During times of market crises, the sources of financing can dry up (e.g., the
              commercial paper market or the repo market seizing up) and borrowing costs can
              increase significantly over a short period of time. In either case, investors can be
              forced to sell assets at depressed values to meet their obligations – which compounds
              losses and needs to be avoided. As a result, liquidity management becomes even more
              critical, especially for investors that are already cashflow negative (e.g., where
              they pay out more to beneficiaries each year than they receive in new contributions).
            </p>
            <p>
              All that to say, we are under no illusion that leverage is always the right approach.
              It increases certain risks but, if used judiciously in certain contexts it can be
              beneficial and improve the overall characteristics of an investment portfolio.
