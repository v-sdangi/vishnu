              Asset managers are bracing for an unprecedented period of volatility which promises to
              linger for some time to come. What structural advantages is IMCO leveraging to drive
              returns and deal flow against this backdrop? And how is it thinking about
              investors&apos; appetite for credit? We caught up with Jennifer Hartviksen, Managing
              Director of Global Credit, and Christian Hensley, Senior Managing Director of Equities
              and Credit, to find out.
            </p>

            <h2>
              How has the coronavirus pandemic impacted your view of the private and public markets?
              How is it shaping conversations with clients?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Jennifer:</strong> From a credit perspective, the current market volatility
              represents a great opportunity for capital like ours, that can take advantage of both
              structural complexity and illiquidity in the market. It creates the potential for us
              to structure some favourable deals that will look good over a five-year horizon.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also lets us take advantage of IMCO&apos;s “one-stop shop” approach and
              collaborative culture to think across asset classes. For example, one of our
              infrastructure colleagues recently came to us to discuss a co-investment. The
              transaction involved access to capital markets, which of course has been impacted by
              the pandemic, which in turn created a potential opportunity for us to lend money. So
              being part of an integrated team free of silos is a benefit in surfacing these sorts
              of situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Christian:</strong> The pandemic has brought significant disruption to the
              financial markets, and that volatility is driving very different outcomes for
              companies with different liquidity and fundamental profiles. As a potential provider
              of liquidity, we&apos;re poised to capture some really interesting market
              opportunities. Even high-quality names have sold off significantly, which presents an
              opening for us
            </p>
            <p>
              So far, I think our clients are pleased we&apos;re quickly adapting to market
              conditions, exploiting our liquidity and going after some interesting investments.

              How else does IMCO differentiate itself from other asset managers? What&apos;s unique
              about your offering?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Christian:</strong> We differentiate ourselves on speed, quality and cost. In
              terms of speed, we can help our clients get to opportunities and asset classes more
              quickly and cleanly than they might otherwise. When it comes to quality, we&apos;re
              always going to be a friendly, constructive and strategic investor in the companies we
              support. We have a long-term point of view, certainty of capital, and perspective and
              insight. And lastly, we have a very effective cost of capital, which lets us be
              competitive in the markets that we&apos;re addressing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our product offering is also definitely a part of our secret sauce. We have a
              flexible, adaptive and really compelling menu of products, which means we don&apos;t
              force our clients into a “one size fits all solution.” Instead, we&apos;re able to
              match almost any risk and liability profile and adjust as the client&apos;s needs
              evolve.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Why is it so important to think about the long term in an environment like this one?
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Jennifer:</strong> Simply put, it&apos;s impossible to call a top or a bottom
              in the market. Instead, we believe it&apos;s important to have an investment process
              with a long-term horizon that permits averaging into investments and being positioned
              to react to opportunities when the market presents them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Being able to deliver scalable, risk-managed, long-term oriented products that can
              take advantage of these dislocations is a central feature of what we offer. We&apos;ve
              got a really strong team focused on executing on the market insights we&apos;ve
              developed, enabling us to deliver attractive exposures our clients might not be able
              to access themselves.
            </p>
            <h2>What segments of the credit universe are attractive at present?</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Jennifer:</strong> We see both immediate public market dislocation
              opportunities and longer-term private market situations. We have the opportunity to
              capture an illiquidity and complexity premium in private credit, and there are also
              private deals that don&apos;t come to the public market for a variety of reasons like
              size or flexibility of borrower requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Christian:</strong> I would add that we&apos;ve also been cautious for some
              time of cyclical and commodity-driven parts of the market. We generally prefer to find
              a great business and a great management team to invest in over a number of cycles, and
              to patiently build value over time by supplying them with capital. It just fits much
              better with our culture and our long-term horizon.
