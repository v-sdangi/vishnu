              Imco&apos;s public market alternatives program takes dynamic approach to managing risk
              amid pandemic uncertainty
            </h1>
            <p class="a-type--italic">
              A year and a half after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an uneven economic
              recovery is taking hold across markets – and other risk events on the horizon are
              foreshadowing even more volatility ahead. We spoke with
              <a href="/investment-team/oleg-mogilny.html"
                >Oleg Mogilny, Managing Director, Public Market Alternatives</a
              >, to get a sense of how his team is creating value and generating returns in an
              uncertain environment.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Based on what you’re seeing in the markets right now, what’s your perspective on how
              the post-pandemic recovery will unfold?
            </h2>
            <p>
              It’s clear that just as the economic impact of the pandemic was spread unevenly across
              the globe, the recovery is unfolding at different speeds across regions as well. This
              is being driven in large part by the degree of fiscal and monetary support across
              different countries, but also by rates of vaccination and the response by governments
              and public health authorities to address emerging COVID variants. All these factors
              affect economic reopening plans – and therefore the pace and strength of the overall
              recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tone has certainly shifted to the negative as the year unfolded. In the first few
              months of 2021, we saw economies reopening, supported by abundant fiscal and monetary
              stimulus while a market consensus around higher inflation took place. Now, as the
              Delta variant continues to spread, we’re seeing a deceleration in economic growth, a
              lack of progress on fiscal spending in the US and an ongoing uncertainty on the
              inflation outlook. This has led investors to take a more defensive approach such as
              unwinding the reopening trades and focusing on less cyclical segments of the markets.
              We are likely to see more market volatility and change in relative leadership before
              the year end.
            </p>
            <p>
              As for our portfolio, we managed to navigate macro rotations well throughout 2021. Our
              investment goal in this sort of environment is to maintain a diversified strategy mix,
              deliver value-add independently of a market regime and avoid uncompensated risks.
            </p>
            <h2>Inflation remains a hot topic for investors. What’s your view?</h2>
            <p>
              We believe that while the current pace of inflation is relatively high, this is
              largely being driven by transitory factors like supply chain disruptions and labour
              shortages, which can constrain production and drive prices higher. Rising commodity
              prices – energy, industrial metals and so on – have also contributed to a degree. We
              are closely monitoring the potential longer lasting impact from rising wages and
              housing costs. The remaining questions are what would be expected long-term levels of
              inflation after transitory factors fade, whether inflation surprises will continue to
              be positive, on balance, and whether inflation becomes detrimental for the demand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big question is what shape monetary policy will take against this backdrop. As
              we move into the final months of the year, we expect to see some central banks begin
              reducing or tapering the monetary support they’ve been providing, but in a very
              controlled way. That’s because they want to avoid over-reacting to what we believe are
              temporary dynamics driving the rate of inflation right now, while providing enough
              forward guidance for investors.

              Our view is that most of the “low-hanging” opportunities created in the pandemic have
              been exploited by now, and that a balanced approach is required to succeed in a market
              like this. We believe the portfolio needs to stay aware of midcycle rotations, avoid
              crowded strategies while minding key fundamental and structural trends, and tilting
              towards pockets of tactical and niche opportunities in a measured way.

            <h2>
              This has also been a period of transition for IMCO’s Public Market Alternatives
              program.
            </h2>
            <p>
              Yes, we spent the last two years restructuring the bulk of the program, moving away
              from funds-of-funds towards more direct and transparent investments in public market
              alternatives. This coincided with rapidly changing market conditions driven by the
              COVID-related economic shutdown and subsequent recovery.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the volatility throughout the pandemic, we continued to transition the
              structure of our core portfolio while delivering absolute returns and diversification.
              This year we accomplished most of our core portfolio transition, and we are now
              focusing on finding niche and idiosyncratic opportunities where the risk-return
              profile continues to be attractive.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our view is that most of the “low-hanging” opportunities created in the pandemic have
              been exploited by now, and that a balanced approach is required to succeed in a market
              like this. We believe the portfolio needs to stay aware of midcycle rotations, avoid
              crowded strategies while minding key fundamental and structural trends, and tilting
              towards pockets of tactical and niche opportunities in a measured way. Asset
              valuations aren’t cheap either, driven by depressed yields, tight credit spreads and
              equity markets that rallied in 2021 without any significant correction. It’s critical
              to pay close attention to managing risk and diversifying the portfolio in this
              context.
            </p>
            <h2>
              What sort of specific risks are you paying particularly close attention to right now?
            </h2>
            <p>
              As always, there are downside and upside risks, and you must watch both to effectively
              navigate this environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a good chance that upcoming elections in Europe could lead to larger fiscal
              stimulus, higher rates and steeper curves in the region, which could ultimately have
              an impact globally. As we enter a key period where the Federal Open Market Committee
              is set to reduce its stimulus, we’re of course watching for any policy signals from
              the United States, and how it will address the ongoing economic uncertainty in its
              fiscal plans. The more contagious Delta variant is also creating a potential risk to
              the recovery despite higher vaccination rates, raising the concern about other future
              variants. Thanks to high vaccination rates and public measures, the Delta risk is
              expected to roll over soon. Other factors such as higher consumer prices and lower
              housing affordability is an emerging concern for consumers. China’s recent regulatory
              actions added volatility at a time when its economic growth peaked.
            </p>
            <h2>What’s your long-term outlook?</h2>
            <p>
              I think any investor should be wary of predicting the future in an environment as
              uncertain and unprecedented as this one. That said, some longer-term themes have
              immediate implications to investment portfolios today. There are a few we are closely
              monitoring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Against the backdrop of low rates, potentially increasing long-term inflation
              expectations and higher weight of riskier and less liquid assets in investment
              portfolios, finding diversification and managing liquidity come to the forefront of
              our asset allocation discussions. Investors can search for relative value, strategies
              with an inflation hedge component, and/or active mandates such as market timing or
              tail hedging that can generate value add in falling markets to complete a portfolio of
              riskier assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              Among long-term themes, climate change has taken the center stage. Later this year,
              many world leaders will gather at the UN Climate Change Conference to aim for a path
              towards net zero emissions, which could give some hints as to what policy will look
              like in the years and decades to come, and how effective it will be. This also might
              provide some insight or affirmation about what sorts of investments and regulations
              are more likely to happen in developed and emerging markets to achieve meaningful
              progress on climate change, with market implications for many impacted sectors.
