            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="a-type--italic">By Bert Clark, President & CEO</p>
            <p>
              The public health response to COVID-19 and governments’ unprecedented fiscal and
              monetary policy intervention have resulted in an extremely complex investment
              environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              To generate outperformance in the near-to-medium term, investors and their partners
              will need to get the big things right amid stressed economic and market conditions.
              They need to figure out the impact of significant government intervention. And they
              need to identify ways in which their portfolio can take advantage of trends that
              accelerate or emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.
            </p>
            <h3>Getting the Big Things Right</h3>
            <p>
              COVID-19 has reinforced the importance of getting the big things right when it comes
              to investing. At IMCO, this means combining a sophisticated approach to total
              portfolio management with a fundamental approach at the asset class level. <br />We
              are focused on six “big things”.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Asset class diversification</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="l-section__col-2">
            <p>
              We help our clients build diversified portfolios that are designed to perform well
              over the long term in a range of macro-economic environments. This includes, for
              example, owning long nominal bonds to protect in times of market stress; investing in
              growth assets like credit and equity to generate returns in growth environments; and
              using real estate, infrastructure and inflation-linked bonds to perform in
              inflationary environments.

          </div>
          <div class="l-section__col-2">
            <p>
              Liquidity is king when markets are in turmoil. Having adequate liquidity avoids forced
              selling of growth assets in market downturns and allows opportunistic buying when they
              are relatively inexpensive. Institutions that have the courage and liquidity to be
              buyers when fear dominates the markets should succeed at preserving capital and
              enhancing long-term returns.

          </div>
          <div class="l-section__col-2">
            <p>
              Inevitably, every investment strategy has periods of over- and underperformance. If
              investors are overly reliant on a single return-enhancing strategy (such as
              significantly overweighting one asset class or geography, or using significant amounts
              of leverage), then periods of underperformance can be extremely painful, and losses
              hard to recoup. We believe in pursuing diversified strategies for enhancing returns.

            <h3>4. Targeted pursuit of net value add</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="l-section__col-2">
            <p>
              In many public market segments, it is difficult to generate outperformance. We believe
              that combining lower-cost passive, or factor-based, exposures, with more concentrated
              exposures is an effective way to generate outperformance, net of fees.<br />A growing
              number of institutional investors have added private markets to their strategic asset
              mix, eroding the illiquidity premium that private assets offer. Today, investing in
              private markets makes sense only where value enhancement opportunities exist that are
              not possible in a public market context. Asset owners and managers with real
              operational expertise have an advantage.

            <h3>5. Controlling costs</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="l-section__col-2">
            <p>
              Costs are one of the few things an investor can control. Costs should be a key area of
              focus for any well-run organization. This means using scale and market presence to
              negotiate better fees from external managers. It means only pursuing higher-cost
              active strategies in market segments where they have a good chance of adding value. It
              also means internalizing investment activities where equivalent results can be
              generated at a lower cost.<br />Building an organization that can manage liquidity,
              partner with external managers on an efficient basis, and properly structure asset
              classes requires scale. Size matters when it comes to costs and so smaller
              organizations should to consider consolidating asset management efforts.

            <p>
              Powerful trends may be obvious but positioning investment portfolios to avoid or
              benefit from them takes discipline. For example, the rise of online shopping was
              evident, but having the discipline to reduce retail real estate holdings before this
              trend really started to hurt real estate valuations was not common. Today, the
              decarbonization initiatives required to deal with the threat of global warming pose
              the same kind of challenges. Having the discipline to get ahead of climate-related
              risks and see emerging opportunities will take discipline.

            <h3>Navigating Today’s Markets</h3>
            <p>
              The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on markets and the global economy are not yet clear.
              To minimize risks and benefit from opportunities in these uncertain times, it is key
              to get the big things right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investors should rebalance their portfolios (which may mean systematically buying
              public equities) to prepare for various scenarios: the possibility that the economy
              will recover relatively quickly, and the possibility of significant and lasting damage
              to certain segments. Rebalancing, coupled with strong liquidity management, allows
              investors to obtain growth assets at lower valuations than we have seen in some time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investors should assess the expected risk/return characteristics of all asset classes
              in stressed macro-economic environments. They should modestly tilt their asset mix in
              the direction of asset classes with the best opportunities, on a risk-adjusted basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investors should also consider pursuing net value add within asset classes in a very
              targeted way, based on their own strong competitive advantage or that of their
              partners. Today we believe that a competitive advantage in navigating stressed
              economic environments combined with unprecedented public policy actions will give
              well-positioned investors an opportunity to outperform.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the S&P has bounced back considerably from its March low, we do not see global
              economic growth returning to pre-March 2020 levels this year. Some effects of the
              COVID-19 crisis are certain to be felt well into 2021, if not longer.
            </p>
            <p>
              This investment environment is made more complex by the extraordinary fiscal and
              monetary policy intervention that governments have taken to contain COVID-19.
              Governments have lowered policy interest rates, established direct lending facilities
              for businesses and direct wage subsidies for workers, pressured banks to lower
              consumer credit card rates, intervened in the debt capital markets and agreed to bail
              out certain industries. The speed, breadth and magnitude of these actions are
              unprecedented. Market volatility is incredibly high in this environment and
              opportunities may not persist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Generating outperformance over the near to medium term therefore requires expertise
              operating in a stressed economic environment, combined with expertise in understanding
              the potential effects of unprecedented government intervention.
            </p>
            <h3>Our View on the Big Trends</h3>
            <p>
              Powerful trends were underway before COVID-19 (e.g., a lower-for-longer rate
              environment, deceleration in globalization, ongoing central bank involvement in
              capital markets, dominance of larger companies, increased online commerce and a shift
              to remote working). Investors now need to consider how these trends may accelerate,
              and where the risks and opportunities lie.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the COVID-19 outbreak, demographic trends in the largest economies and high
              corporate and individual indebtedness, among other factors, seemed very likely to
              suppress interest rates and future returns from most asset classes. We believe that
              the economic downturn resulting from COVID-19 will result in lower economic growth for
              some time and inflict real economic damage on many companies and industries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slowing globalization began before the COVID-19 outbreak. This trend may accelerate as
              some governments have closed borders to contain the virus, and companies and countries
              are assessing supply chain vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Investors might not accurately predict the speed or full impact of these trends, but
              we must keep a careful eye on them, and position accordingly.
